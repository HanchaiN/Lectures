# Abel's Identity

For second-order [[Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation|Homogeneous LDE]] $y^{\prime\prime}+p y^{\prime}+q y = 0$ on an interval of the real line with real-valued or complex-valued continuous functions $p$ and $q$, the [[Wronskian]] $W(y_{1},y_{2})$ of two real-valued or complex-valued solutions $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ of this differential equation satisfies

$$
W\left(y_{1},y_{2}\right)\left(x\right)=W\left(y_{1},y_{2}\right)\left(x_{0}\right)\cdot e^{-\int_{x_{0}}^{x}p(t)dt}
$$
