# Inhomogeneous Linear Differential Equation

$$
L\left[y\right]=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}(t)y^{(i)}(t)=g(t)\ne0
$$

- General solution: $y_{c}+y_{p}$ where
	- Complementary function ($y_{c}$) is the solutions of $L[y] = 0$ ([[Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation|Homogeneous LDE]]).
	- Particular integral ($y_{p}$) is a solution of the equation.

## Solving Techniques

- [[Variation of Parameter]] (for $a_{i}\sim\text{const.}$)
