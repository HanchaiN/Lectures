# Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation

$$
L[y]=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}(t)y^{(i)}(t)=0
$$

where $L$ is a [[Linear Transformation|Linear]] differential operator

- There are $n$ linearly-independent solutions for $n$-th order [[Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation|Homogeneous LDE]].
	- Superposition Principle: If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions of the [[Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation|Homogeneous LDE]], their linear combinations (i.e. $c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}$) are also solutions of the same DE.
	- The final solution can be solved using the [[Wronskian]].
