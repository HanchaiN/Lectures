# Ordinary Differential Equation

Single independent variable

$$
F\left(t,y,y^{\prime},\dots,y^{(n)}\right)=0
$$where $u^{\prime}=\frac{d}{dt}u$ and $u^{(n)}=\frac{d^{n}}{dt^{n}}u$.

Can be rewritten as first-order [[System of Ordinary Differential Equations]] by let $y_{i}=y_{i-1}^{\prime}=y^{(i)}$ and $y_{0}=y$.
