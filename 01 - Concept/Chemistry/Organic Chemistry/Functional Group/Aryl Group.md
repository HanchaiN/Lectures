- HÃ¼ckel's rule for aromaticity
	- [[Cyclic Hydrocarbon|Cyclic]] planar structure
	- Conjugated $\pi$-bond across the cycle
		- $\pi$-bond with atoms outside the system count as valid part of the system
		- Lone pair may or may not align and be a valid part of the system
	- ($4n+2$) $\pi$-electrons in the conjugated system
		- Electrons in the $\pi$-bond with atoms outside the system doesn't since it cannot delocalize.
