# Unimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution of Alkyl Halide

$$
\ce{Nu- + R-X -> Nu-R + X-}
$$

| Starting Material | Reagent | Intermediate | Product |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [[Alkyl Group\|Alkyl]] [[Halo Group\|Halide]] | Weak [[Nucleophile]] | [[Carbocation]] | Depends |

- Reagent  
         - $\ce{H2O}$ → $\ce{-OH}$  
         - $\ce{ROH}$ → $\ce{-OR}$  
         - $\ce{H2S}$ → $\ce{-SH}$  
         - $\ce{NHR2}$ → $\ce{-NR2}$
- Mechanism: [[Unimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution]]
- [[Carbocation]] attract [[Nucleophile]] → Prefer Tertiary Product
- $\ce{X-}$ as leaving group → Prefer protic solvent ($\ce{H+ + X- <=> HX}$)
