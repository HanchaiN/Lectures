# Acidity of Hydrocarbons

$$
\ce{C-H <=> C- + H+}
$$

- $\ce{R#CH} > \ce{R2C=CHR} > \ce{CHR3}$
	- Stability of [[Carbanion]]
	- $\ce{R#CH}$ is just acidic enough for $\ce{NaNH2}$ ($\ce{NaOH}$ and $\ce{NaOEt}$ is not enough)
- Starting Material: [[Alkyl Group|Alkane]] / [[Alkenyl Group|Alkene]] / [[Alkynyl Group|Alkyne]]
