# Acidity of Hydrocarbons

$$
\ce{C-H <=> C- + H+}
$$

| Starting Material | Reagent | Intermediate | Product |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Terminal-[[Alkynyl Group\|Alkyne]] | $\ce{NaNH2}$ | - | $\ce{H+}$,<br>[[Carbanion]] |

- $\ce{R#CH}$ is just acidic enough for $\ce{NaNH2}$ ($\ce{NaOH}$ and $\ce{NaOEt}$ is not basic enough)
- $\ce{R#CH} > \ce{R2C=CHR} > \ce{CHR3}$
	- Due to Stability of [[Carbanion]]
