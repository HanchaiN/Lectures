# Addition Reaction

$$
\ce{C=C + Y-Z -> C(Y)-C(Z)}
$$

- By Mechanism
	- Electrophilic Addition: $\ce{C=C + E+ -> C(E)-C+}$
		- Stability of Carbocation
		- Possible Rearrangement
	- Radical Addition: $\ce{C=C + Rad. -> C(Rad)-C.}$
		- Stability of Carbon Radical
	- Nucleophilic Addition: $\ce{C=C + Nu- -> C(Nu)-C-}$
		- Stability of Carbanion
- By Stereochemistry: Syn- / Anti- / Non-stereospecific
- Markovnikov's Rule: Stability of Ions/Radicals â†’ $\ce{H}$ prefer $\ce{C}$ with more $\ce{H}$
	- Markovnikov Addition
	- Anti-Markovnikov Addition
