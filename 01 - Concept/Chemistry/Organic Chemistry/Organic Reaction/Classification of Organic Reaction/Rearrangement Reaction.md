# Rearrangement Reaction

$$
\ce{R3C-CH+-R <=>> R2C+-CR2}
$$

- [[Carbocation]]
- Move cation to the next carbon to increase stability
- 1,2-hydride-shift / 1,2-alkyl-shift
	- Alkyl shift can cause ring expansion which may stabilize the ring
- Can shift multiple times (1,2-rearrangement at a time)
	- Greedy-ish: May shift if equal stability; May shift to unstable configuration to shift again to more stable configuration
- [[Carbon Radical]] and [[Carbanion]] is too reactive
