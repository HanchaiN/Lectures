# Elimination Reaction

$$
\ce{C(Y)-C(Z) -> C=C + Y-Z}
$$

- By Stereochemistry: Syn- / Anti- / Non-stereospecific
- Zaitsev's Rule: Prefer double bond with more substituents (experimental data)
	- Zaitsev Elimination
	- Hofmann Elimination: Opposite (Steric Interaction)
		- Apply when Large Leaving Group and/or Alkali (Attacker)
