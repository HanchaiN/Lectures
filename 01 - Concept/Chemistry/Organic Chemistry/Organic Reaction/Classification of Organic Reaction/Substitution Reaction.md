# Substitution Reaction

$$
\ce{C-L + Z -> C-Z + L}
$$

- By Mechanism
	- Radical Substitution: $\ce{C-H + Br2 ->[Br2 + h\nu / \Delta -> 2 Br.][H. + Br. -> HBr] C-Br + HBr}$
	- Nucleophilic Substitution: $\ce{C-OH + Br- -> C-Br + H+}$
	- Electrophilic Substitution: $\ce{Ph-H + CH3Cl ->[AlCl3] Ph-CH3 + HCl}$
- By Stereochemistry: Retention / Inversion / Non-stereospecific
