[[Substitution Reaction]]
- Rearrangement Reaction
	- Carbocation: $\ce{R3C-CH+-R <=>> R2C+-CR2}$
		- Move to the next carbon to increase stability
		- 1,2-hydride-shift / 1,2-alkyl-shift
			- Alkyl shift can cause ring expansion which may stabilize the ring
		- Can shift multiple times (1,2-rearrangement at a time)
			- Greedy-ish: May shift if equal stability; May shift to unstable configuration to shift again to more stable configuration
	- Carbon radical and Carbanion is too reactive
- Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
	- Oxidation Number (for $\ce{C}$)
		1. Assume neutral (initial → 0)
		2. Count bond with following (multiple bond count multiple times)
			- Carbons → No Change
			- Electropositive Atoms ($\ce{H}$, $\ce{M}$: Metals) → +1
			- Electronegative atom ($\ce{O}$, $\ce{N}$, $\ce{S}$, $\ce{X}$: Halides) → -1
	- Oxidation ($\hat{o}$): Less Oxidation Number: More Electronegative Atoms
	- Reduction: More Oxidation Number: More Electropositive Atoms
