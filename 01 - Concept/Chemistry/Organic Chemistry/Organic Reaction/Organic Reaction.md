# Chemical Reactions

- [[Addition Reaction]]
- [[Elimination Reaction]]
- [[Substitution Reaction]]
- [[Rearrangement Reaction]]
- Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
    - Oxidation Number (for $\ce{C}$)  
                1. Assume neutral (initial → 0)  
                2. Count bond with following (multiple bond count multiple times)  
                        - Carbons → No Change  
                        - Electropositive Atoms ($\ce{H}$, $\ce{M}$: Metals) → +1  
                        - Electronegative atom ($\ce{O}$, $\ce{N}$, $\ce{S}$, $\ce{X}$: Halides) → -1
    - Oxidation ($\hat{o}$): Less Oxidation Number: More Electronegative Atoms
    - Reduction: More Oxidation Number: More Electropositive Atoms
