# Hydrogen Bonding

- (Partially)-Positively charged Hydrogen & Lone Electron Pair of Atoms w/ high [[Electronegativity]]
  - Partially-Positively charged Hydrogen: Bonds with atoms w/ high [[Electronegativity]]
  - Atoms w/ high [[Electronegativity]]: e.g. $\ce{F}$, $\ce{O}$, $\ce{N}$
- Significantly weaker than [[Covalent Bonding]] but stronger than [[Dipole-Dipole Attraction]]
