# Hybrid Orbital

- Hybridization (Mixing/Superposition) of multiple [[Atomic Orbital]]
	1. (Optional) Excite electron from ground state
	2. Average to same energy level orbitals
- Maximize overlapping

## Shape

- $sp^3$ → Tetrahedral ($109.5\degree$)
- $sp^2$ → Trigonal planar ($120\degree$)
- $sp$ → Linear ($180\degree$)
