# Intermolecular Interaction

- [[Ionic Bonding|Electrostatic Attraction]]
- Dipole-dipole Attraction
	- Charge attraction
- Van der Waals Attraction (Non-polar Interaction but may be possible in polar molecule)
	- London Dispersion Forces
	- Hydrophobic Interaction
	- Depends on molecular surface area (heuristically, molecular weight)
	- Temporary uneven charge distribution
- Hydrogen bonding
	- (Partially)-Positively charged Hydrogen & Atoms w/ high [[Elect]] & lone electron pair
	- Significantly weaker than [[Covalent Bonding]] but stronger than dipole-dipole interaction
