# Double-Slit Experiment

- Wave Behavior of Matter: Self-interference of electron
- Classical Wave: Diffract around slits and interfere with instance of the same wave from the different slit causing the interference pattern.
- Classical Particle: May diffract but cannot interfere with itself.
- Quantum Particle: Somehow causing the interference pattern â†’ Must interfere with itself.
	- One particle will lands on just one point but together forms a clear distribution like that of the interference pattern.
