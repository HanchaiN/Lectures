# Equipartition Theorem

In [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium"), energy is shared equally among all of its various forms

$$
\left\langle x_{m}\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}}\right\rangle=\delta_{mn}k_{B}T
$$

- For quadratic degree of freedom $H_{n}=a_{n}x_{n}^{2}$, expected energy distributed in the degree of freedom is $\left\langle H_{n}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2}k_{B}T$.
