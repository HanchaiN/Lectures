# The Passage of Food

* Digestive System
  * Gastrointestinal Tract (Alimentary Canal)
    * Mouth: Ingestion, Mechanical & Chemical Digestion
    * Pharynx: Move food from oral cavity to esophagus
    * Esophagus: Move food from pharynx to stomach
    * Stomach: Mechanical & Chemical (Gastric Enzyme)
    * Small Intestines: Digestion & Absorption
    * Large Intestines
    * Anus: Defecation
  * Accessory Digestive Organs
    * Salivary Glands: Digestive Enzymes, Moises & Mixing
    * Liver: Bile production
    * Gallbladder: Bile Storage
    * Pancreas: Digestive Enzymes, Hormones
* Tissue Layers of GI Tract
  * Mucosa: Direct contact w/ Food
    * Epithelium
    * Lamina Propria
  * Submucosa: Blood & Lymph vessels, Submucosal Glands, Nerves
    * Submucosal plexus: Nerve
  * Muscularis: Muscular, Mechanical Digestion, Food Motion
    * Myenteric plexus: Nerve (between muscle fibers)
  * Serosa, Adventitia: Connective tissue w/, w/o Visceral peritoneum resp.
* Digestive Processes
  * Fundamental Activities
    * Ingestion
    * Propulsion (Deglutiton, Peristalsis)
    * Chemical Digestion
    * Mechanical Digestion (Chewing, Churning, Segmentation)
    * Absorption
    * Defecation
  * Voluntary / Involuntary
  * Hormonal / Neural Regulation
  * Many activities per organs and vice versa
* Deglutition (Swallowing)
  * Voluntary Phase: Oral / Buccal
    * Tongue moves upward & backward
    * Bolus pushed into Oropharynx
  * Pharyngeal Phase
    * Uvula & Soft palate moves upward & close nasopharynx
      * Prevent aspiration & choking
    * Laryngeal muscles contraction
    * Pharyngeal constrictor muscles contraction
    * Upper esophageal sphincter relaxation
  * Esophageal phase
    * Initiation of Peristalsis
    * Bolus moves toward stomach
    * Lower esophageal sphincter relaxation
* Esophagus
  * Parts
    * Upper Third: Cervical part: Skeletal Muscle
    * Lower Third: Abdominal part: Smooth Muscle
    * Middle Third: Thoracic part: Mixed
  * Layers
    * Mucosa: Non-keratinized, Stratified squamous epithelium
    * Submucosa: Esophageal gland
    * Muscularis Externa: Peristalsis
      * Inner Circular Muscle
      * Outer Longitudinal Muscle
    * Adventitia (w/o visceral peritoneum)
* Stomach
  * Regions
    * Fundus: Curved cap
    * Cardia: Connected to esophagus
    * Body: Curved body (Lesser / Greater Curvature)
    * Pylorus: Shrink, Connected to duodenum
      * Pyloric Sphincter
  * Layers
    * Rugae: Folding of mucosa, submucosa
    * Mucosa: Simple Columnar Epithelium
      * Gastric Gland @ Gastric Pit
        * Parietal Cells: $\ce{HCl}$ acid + Intrinsic Factor (assist Vit. B12 absorption)
        * Chief Cells: Pepsinogen (activated by acid)
        * Mucous Neck Cells: Acidic Mucus
        * Enteroendocrine Cells (G Cells): Gastrin
      * Mucosal Barrier
        * Stomach wall w/ Bicarbonate-rich Mucus
        * Epithelial w/ Tight Junction
        * Stem cell @ Gastric Gland: Replacement
    * Submucosa
    * Muscularis
      * Oblique Layer (Inner)
      * Circular Layer (Middle)
      * Longitudinal Layer (Outer)
    * Serosa (w/ Visceral Peritoneum)
  * Digestive Digestion
    * Mixing Wave (Churning): Mix & Soften Bolus w/ Gastric Juices â†’ Chyme
    * Gastric Emptying: Force Chyme through pyloric sphincter to duodenum
    * Gastric Juices: Chemical digestion (mostly as fundus & body)
      * Acidic chyme inactivate salivary amylase & activate lingual lipase
