# Chemical Equilibrium

* Forward reaction and backward reaction  
  - (Dynamic) Equilibrium: $r\_{\text{forward}}=r\_{\text{reverse}}$ ($Q=K$)  
  - Reaction is often elementary.
* Equilibrium constant: $K=\frac{k\_{\text{forward}}}{k\_{\text{reverse}}}$
* Reaction Quotient: $Q=\frac{\left\[\\text{product}\right\]}{\left\[\\text{reactant}\right\]}$ (including the effect of the reaction order)  
  - Will move towards equilibrium constant.
* Solve with Initial-Change-Equilibrium table
* Le Chatelier's principle: Equilibrium will resist changes (partially)  
  - Equilibrium Constant may change.
* Catalyst doesn't affect equilibrium constant, it only make it reach equilibrium faster.
