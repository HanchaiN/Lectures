* Reaction Rate: $r\_{A}=\frac{d\left\[A\right\]}{dt}$
  * Reaction Order: $r\propto \left\[A\right\]^{n}$
    * Zeroth order: $\left\[A\right\]\\propto -t$
    * First order: $\left\[A\right\]\\propto e^{-t}$
    * Second order: $\left\[A\right\]\\propto \frac{1}{t}$
  * Added reaction: Multiplied Rate
  * Solid reactant is not included.
  * Gaseous reactant may rely on pressure.
  * May not include all reactants in heterogeneous reactions. (included with zeroth order)
* Collision Theory
  * Particle must collide to react
    * Increase conc / Increase Temp → Increase rate
  * The collision must have enough energy ($E\ge E\_{a}$)
  * The collision must be correct orientation
  * Reaction order is equal to the stoichiometric coefficient for elementary reactions (reaction with single step)
* Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution: Energy distribution at temperature
  * High temperature → Shifted toward higher energy
  * Can be renormalize by number of molecules (equiv. concentration)
* Transition state theory
  * Maximum energy (equiv. $E\_{a}$)
  * Partial bonds formed and will be broken, changing the molecules
* Arrhenius equation: $k=Ae^{\frac{-E\_{a}}{RT}}\iff\ln k=\ln A - \frac{E\_{a}}{R}\frac{1}{T}$
* Rate-determining step: slowest step (highest $E\_{a}$), apply for non-elementary reaction
* Catalyst: lower $E\_{a}$, doesn't affect $\Delta H$
  * Homogeneous catalyst: same phase as mixture
  * Lock-and-key model: fixed active site matches the substrates
  * Induced-fit model: active site change shape to bind more effectively
