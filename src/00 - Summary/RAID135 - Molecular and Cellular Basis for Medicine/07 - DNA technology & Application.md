# DNA technology & Application

* Cloning
  * Cut w/ Restriction enzyme
    * Cut original portion
    * Cut gap in target DNA vector
      * Usually bacterial plasmid
    * Product
      * Blunt Ends
      * Sticking Ends → Original portion should be compatible
        * 5'-protuding Ends
        * 3'-protuding Ends
  * Paste w/ Ligase
  * Transfer
    * Insert DNA Vector to target "cell"
      * Transformation: Plasmid intake
      * Transduction: Via bacteriophage
      * Conjugation: Via sex pilus
      * Transfection: induced plasmid intake
  * Select & Screen
    * Confirm successful gene transfer
    * Usually via inserting antibiotic resistance gene
* DNA Editing
  * CRISPR-Cas System
    * CRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
    * Cas: CRISPR-associated proteins
    * Originally bacterial immune response against viruses
      * Recognize invader's sequence
        * Bacterial gene includes Cas genes and Repeat-Spacer region
          * Repeat-Spacer → Guide crRNA
          * Spacer matches invader's sequence
          * Cas genes → Cas Complex
          * Cas Complex + crRNA → Protospacer
      * Activate destruction system
      * Binds with invader's sequence and eliminate
    * Application in gene therapy
      * Recognize where to perform actions
        * Gene addition
        * Gene disruption
        * Gene correction
  * Lentivirus System
* Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
  * Materials
    * DNA template (Double-stranded DNA; dsDNA)
    * DNA Polymerase
    * Deoxy Nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)
    * DNA Primers
  * Temperature Cycle: Double DNA amount
    * Denaturation: dsDNA → ssDNA
      * High temp.
    * Annealing: ssDNA + Primer
      * Low temp.
    * Extension: DNA Pol.
      * Warm temp.
  * Amplification → Ready for measurement
    * Visible in Amplicon: Gel Electrophoresis
  * Alternative
    * Reverse transcriptase PCR
* Application
  * Biologically-Synthesized Insulin from bacteria
