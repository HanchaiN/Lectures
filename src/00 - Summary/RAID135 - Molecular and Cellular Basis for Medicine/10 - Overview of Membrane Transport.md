# Overview of Membrane Transport

* Plasma membrane: semi-permeable lipid bilayer w/ proteins
  * Selective transport, Cell recognition, Cell communication
  * Membrane fluidity: More unsaturated, Less cholesterol
  * Permeability: Small, Hydrophobic > Saturated HC > Polar
  * Membrane protein: Peripheral / Integral
    * Integral Type 1: single transmembrane region, C-terminus cytosolic
    * Integral Type 2: single transmembrane region, N-terminus cytosolic
    * Integral Type 3: multiple transmembrane region
    * Integral Type 4: channel from multiple polypeptide chain
    * Integral Type 5: Linked w/ lipid
    * Integral Type 6: Transmembrane + Linked lipid
    * Carrier: Transporter w/ conformation change (Slower, w/ saturation)
      * Solute carrier
        * Mitochondrial transporter / Coupled transporter / Exchanger / Passive Transporter / Vasicular Transport
      * Uniport: One kind of molecule
      * Symport: Two kinds same direction
      * Antiport: Two kinds different direction
    * Channel: (Gated / Open); mechanically / voltage / chemically
* Passive Transport: Conc. grad. → No ATP required
  * Simple Diffusion: w/o protein; $\varphi\propto A\cdot D\cdot\nabla\left\[X\right\]$; Permeability: $D\propto\frac{\text{lipid sol.}}{\text{Mol. Size}}$
  * Facilitated Diffusion: w/ protein ← affected by factors; large, nonpolar
  * Ion channel: w/ protein ← large ion, polar
  * Aquaporin: w/ protein; osmosis
* Active Transport: against grad. → required ATP
  * Protein-mediated
    * Primary (Direct) Active Transport: Pumped w/ ATP
    * Secondary (Indirect) Active Transport
      * Use Primary Active Transport to create grad.
      * Electrochemical gradient → Secondary transport carrier protein
  * Vascular (Bulk) transport
    * Exocytosis, Endocytosis, Phagocytosis
