# Structure and Function of Cell, Content Trafficking

* Cells: organism; organisms = cell / aggregated cells
  * Basic functional unit; Can individually perform process of life
* Cell Membrane
  * Physical isolation, structural support
  * Regulation of exchange, communication
  * Fluid mosaic model: phospholipid bilayers w/ integral protein
    * Cholesterol (mixed w/ phospholipid bilayers)
    * Sphingolipid (+ Carbohydrates → Glycolipids)
    * Proteins (+ Carbohydrates → Glycoproteins)
      * Membrane-spanning $\alpha$-helix ($\approx$ 20 AA)
        * Single / multiple / half-way
      * Covalently bonded w/ phospholipid (w/ or w/o oligosaccharide)
      * Intermolecularly bonded w/ integral protein
* Nucleus
  * DNA Storage
  * Nuclear Envelope
  * Nuclear Pore
  * Nucleolus: Ribosomal RNA synthesis
* Cytosol: Intracellular fluid
* Inclusions: insoluble particles aka non-membranous organelles
  * Ribosome
    * Fixed ribosome: attached to organelles' membrane → export
    * Free ribosome: in cytosol → cellular function
* Insoluble protein fibers: aka cytoskeleton
  * Shape, Movement
  * Tissue Assembly, Internal Organization, Intracellular Transport
  * Microfilament: actin (globular), $\diameter = \pu{7 nm}$
    * Myosin Fiber + Actin fiber → Muscle contraction
  * Intermediate filament: keratin, neurofilament (filaments), $\diameter = \pu{10 nm}$
  * Microtubules: tubulin (globular), $\diameter = \pu{25 nm}$
    * Centrioles: DNA movement during cell division
    * Cilia
      * hairlike
      * upper airway, female reproductive tract
      * 9 pairs + 2 central
    * Flagella
      * Longer cilia
      * free-floating single cells
    * Kinesin / Dyneins → vesicle movement along microtubules
* Organelles: membrane-bound compartment w/ role in cellular function
  * Mitochondria
    * Energy production
    * Apoptosis (Program cell death)
    * Inner / Outer membrane
    * Mitochondrial matrix: enzymes, ribosomes, DNA
    * Intermembrane space → ATP production
  * Endoplasmic Reticulum: Synthesis, Storage, Transport biomolecules
    * Smooth ER: Fatty acids, Steroids, Lipid
      * Liver, Kidney → Detoxify / Inactivate drug
      * Skeletal muscle → $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ storage
    * Rough ER: Protein (Enzymes, Hormones)
