# Gene Expression, Transcription, Post-transcriptional Modification

* Different Cell: Same gene + Different Expression → Different Functionality
* RNA: Intermediates in the (directional) flow of genetic information
  * mRNA: messenger
  * ncRNA: non-coding RNA
    * housekeeping ncRNA
      * tRNA: transfer (amino acids)
      * rRNA: ribosomal
    * regulatory ncRNA
      * lncRNA: long non-coding ($\ge 200$ nucleotides)
      * small ncRNA (new, researching)
        * microRNA (19-22 nucleotides)
          * Regulate stability & translation of mRNAs
        * snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA)
          * Processing rRNAs in nucleolus
        * siRNA (small interfering RNA)
          * Inhibit virus production
        * snRNA (small nuclear RNA)
          * Spliceosome: splicing eukaryotic RNAs
        * piRNA (Piwi-interacting RNA)
* mRNA
  * 5'-Cap
  * 5'-Untranslated region
    * Ribosome-binding site
  * Coding Region
    * Start Codon
    * Stop Codon
  * 3'-Untranslated region
  * Poly(A) tail (~250 nucleotides)
* tRNA
  * Acceptor stem
    * 3' Amino Acid Attachment site (GCC-3')
  * D-Arm (5' side)
  * Anticodon Arm
  * Variable Arm, T-Arm (3' side)
* rRNA (longer and have more loops than tRNA)
  * binds with Ribosome subunits
  * Antibiotics can target ribosome

## Transcription

* DNA → RNA
  * RNA may reversed transcribed into DNA
    * Some viruses (HIV)
    * Retrotransposons
      * DNA → RNA → bind and inserted to different DNA region
* Overview
  * Initiation
    * Regulatory Sequence (Upstream)
      * Biding site for regulatory Proteins → Transcription Rate
    * Promoter (Sequence)
      * Initiation site
      * Declare direction of transcription (identify coding strand)
        * Consensus Sequence
  * Elongation
    * 5'-to-3' of RNA
    * 3'-to-5' of template strand / non–coding strand / antisense strand
    * similar to 5'-to-3' of non-template strand / coding strand / sense strand
    * RNA Polymerase
      * Also acts as topoisomerase and helicase
  * Termination
    * Terminator (Sequence)
* Prokaryotic
  * Initiation
    * Promoter (Sequence)
      * Note: Showing Coding Strand
      * Prokaryotic Housekeeping: TTGACA;TATAAT
      * Prokaryotic Stress Response: TTGACA;TATAAT
    * RNA Polymerase + $\sigma$ factor: Holoenzyme → read from Binding site to Promoter
      * $\sigma$ factor is released at promoter → begin transcription
  * Elongation
  * Termination
    * Terminator (Sequence)
      * GC sequence
        * slow down RNA Pol.
        * Forms strong loop
      * T sequence
        * Synthesize Poly U
    * $\rho$-dependent: GC terminator
      * $\rho$-recognition site (rut) before terminator
      * $\rho$-protein binds to rut on RNA
      * Strong RNA loop → binds and stops RNA Pol
      * RNA Pol slow down → $\rho$-protein catches up
      * $\rho$-protein unbind RNA Pol and release RNA
    * $\rho$-independent: T terminator
      * Upstream RNA loop → binds and stops RNA Pol
      * NusA binds with RNA Pol
      * Weak U-A bond release RNA from template DNA
* Eukaryotic (Note: Focus on RNA Pol II-based)
  * Initiation
    * Regulatory Sequence (Upstream)
      * (Pol II)
        * GC boxes, CAAT boxes
    * Promoter (Sequence)
      * Flexible Promoter
      * Different between RNA Pols
      * (Pol II)
        * TATAAA (TATA box; -25 bp)
        * 2 Pyrimidine + C + A + 5 Pyrimidine
          * Begin translation at A (+1)
  * Elongation
  * Termination
    * Terminator (Sequence)
