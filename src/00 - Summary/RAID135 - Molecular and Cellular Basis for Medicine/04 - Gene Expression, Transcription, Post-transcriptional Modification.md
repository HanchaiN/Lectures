# Gene Expression, Transcription, Post-transcriptional Modification

* Different Cell: Same gene + Different Expression → Different Functionality
* RNA: Intermediates in the (directional) flow of genetic information
  * mRNA: messenger
  * ncRNA: non-coding RNA
    * housekeeping ncRNA
      * tRNA: transfer (amino acids)

  * Antibiotics can target ribosome

## Transcription

* DNA → RNA
  * RNA may reversed transcribed into DNA
    * Some viruses (HIV)
    * Retrotransposons
      * DNA → RNA → bind and inserted to different DNA region
* Overview
  * Initiation
    * Regulatory Sequence (Upstream)
      * Binding site for regulatory Proteins → Transcription Rate
    * Promoter (Sequence)
      * Initiation site (Maybe binding site for RNA Polymerase)
      * Declare direction of transcription (identify coding strand)
        * Consensus Sequence
  * Elongation
    * 5'-to-3' of RNA
    * 3'-to-5' of template strand / non–coding strand / antisense strand
    * similar to 5'-to-3' of non-template strand / coding strand / sense strand
    * RNA Polymerase
      * Also acts as topoisomerase and helicase
  * Termination
    * Terminator (Sequence)
* Prokaryotic
  * Initiation
    * Promoter (Sequence)
      * Note: Showing Coding Strand
      * Prokaryotic Housekeeping: TTGACA;TATAAT
      * Prokaryotic Stress Response: TTGACA;TATAAT
    * RNA Polymerase + $\sigma$ factor: Holoenzyme → read from Binding site to Promoter
      * $\sigma$ factor is released at promoter → begin transcription
  * Elongation
  * Termination
    * Terminator (Sequence)
      * GC sequence
        * slow down RNA Pol.
        * Forms strong loop
      * Poly A sequence
        * Synthesize Poly U
    * $\rho$-dependent: GC terminator
      * $\rho$-recognition site (rut) before terminator
      * $\rho$-protein binds to rut on RNA
      * Strong RNA loop → binds and stops RNA Pol
      * RNA Pol slow down → $\rho$-protein catches up
      * $\rho$-protein unbind RNA Pol and release RNA
    * $\rho$-independent: Poly A terminator
      * Upstream RNA loop → binds and stops RNA Pol
      * NusA binds with RNA Pol
      * Weak U-A bond release RNA from template DNA
  * Polycistronic mRNA: multiple proteins in one mRNA
* Eukaryotic (Note: Focus on RNA Pol II)
  * Initiation
    * Regulatory Sequence (Upstream)
      * (Pol II)
        * GC boxes, CAAT boxes
      * Attached by transcription factors (up to -100 kb)
        * Enhancer Sequence + Activator (or Coactivator) Protein
          * Mediating complex fomation → increase transcription rate
        * Silencer Sequence + Repressor (or Corepressor) Protein
          * Preventing complex fomation → decrease transcription rate
    * Promoter (Sequence)
      * Flexible Promoter
      * Different between RNA Pols
      * (Pol II)
        * TATAAA (TATA box; -25 bp)
        * 2 Pyrimidine + C + A + 5 Pyrimidine
          * Begin translation at A (+1)
    * RNA Pol binds with transcription factor
      * Catalyzed by Mediator
    * RNA Pol (w/ transcription factor) phosphorylate → Activation
  * Elongation
  * Termination
    * Terminator (Sequence)
      * Polyadenylation signal sequence (Poly A)
    * RNA is cleaved after poly A sequence (RNA Pol continues)
    * Allosteric Model: RNA Pol II dissociate w/ DNA
    * Torpedo Model: Exonuclease attatch overtranscripted RNA and catches up to RNA Pol II → Termination
  * Monocistronic mRNA: one protein per mRNA
