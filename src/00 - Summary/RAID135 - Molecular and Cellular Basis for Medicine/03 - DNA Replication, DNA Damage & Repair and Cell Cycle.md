# DNA Replication, DNA Damage & Repair and Cell Cycle

## Cell Cycle

* Quiescent (G0)
  * Not actively preparing cell division
  * After M, Some cells can return to G1
* Interphase
  * Gap / Growth (G1)
    * Accumulating Resources and Energy
  * Synthesis (S)
    * DNA Replication → Sister Chromatids (attached at centromere)
    * Duplicate Microtubule-organizing Structure (Centrosome)
  * Gap / Growth (G2)
    * Re-organize Cytoplasm
    * Duplicate Organelles and Synthesize Proteins
* Mitotic Phase (M)
  * Karyokinesis / Mitosis: Separate DNA, Cytoplasm
    * Prophase
      * Centrioles and Spindle Fibers
      * Chromatin → (Condensed) Chromosome
    * Prometaphase
      * Nuclear Envelope Dissolves
      * Spindle fibers attach kinetochore (at Centromere)
    * Metaphase
      * Alignment of Chromosomes
    * Anaphase
      * Sister Chromatids Split and pulled
    * Telophase
      * Nuclear Envelope Reforms
  * Cytokinesis: Separate Cytosol
* Meiosis
  * G1 S G2 M1 M2
  * Meiosis I (M1)
    * Prophase I
      * Chromosome aligns with Homologue partner → Crossing Over
    * Metaphase I
      * Maternal / Paternal Chromosomes can independently go to either side
    * Separation of Homologous Chromosome (Sister Chromatids attached)
  * Meiosis II (M2): ~Mitosis

## Cell Cycle Control System

* Regulate w/ 3 main transition points / Checkpoints

## Reference

* Handout RAID135
