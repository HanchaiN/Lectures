# Receptor and Signal Transduction

* Cell-to-cell communication
  * Electrical: Membrane potential (Fast, Mostly nervous system)
  * Chemical: Secreted; Ligands, binds w/ receptor proteins
  * Local communication
    * Gap Junction: Electrical, Ions, Small molecules (AA, ATP, cAMP)
    * Contact-dependent: Antigens, immune, growth & development
    * Autocrine / Paracrine: Self / neighbors (diffusion), Inflammation cytokine
  * Long-distance communication
    * Endocrine glands via Blood
      * Target w/ Receptors for specific hormone response
    * Neurotransmitter: Chemical via Diffusion
    * Neurohormones: Chemical via Blood
* Signaling Pathway
  * Chemical + Receptor → Response (chained)
  * Cellular Response: Modify proteins / Synthesize protein
  * Signal Transduction
    * Ligand-receptor binding (activation) → Second messenger
    * Second messenger + Target protein → Cellular Response
  * Signal Cascade: Signal + Inactive → Active (will act as Signal)
    * Slow
    * Checkpoints (multiple inhibition / activation pathway)
  * Signal Amplification: 1 Signal → Multiple Messenger
    * Ligand-Receptor binding → Amplifier Enzyme Activation
* Target Receptor
  * Intracellular Receptor (second messenger / lipophilic signal)
    * Cytoplasmic / Nuclear Receptor
    * Slow cellular response; Genetic activity
      * Activator protein (coactivator)
  * Extracellular Receptor: Membrane receptor
    * Rapid cellular response
    * Receptor-channel (Ligand-gated channel)
    * G protein-coupled receptor
    * Catalytic Receptor
      * Receptor-Enzyme (Ligand-activated enzyme)
      * Integrin Receptor (Alters enzymes / cytoskeleton)
* Ligand-gated ion channels
  * Most Rapid
  * Alters ion permeability → membrane potential → voltage-sensitive proteins
  * e.g. synapse / neuromuscular junction
* G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
  * Seven-transmembrane-spanning proteins (7TM)
    * Have 7 Membrane-spanning region through membrane
    * 3 intracellular loops, 3 extracellular loops → Form active site
    * Extracellular domains binds w/ binding site (Pocket-like)
    * N-terminus at extracellular
    * C-terminus at intracellular; Cytoplasmic tail linked to trimeric G proteins
  * Ligand → GPCRs activates → G protein activates → Secondary messenger
  * G<sub>αs</sub>: Activate adenylyl cyclase → more cAMP: secondary messenger
    * Phosphodiesterase: cAMP → 5'-AMP (natural degradation)
    * Protein kinase A → Protein Phosphorylation (Activation) → Response
  * G<sub>αi</sub>: Inhibit adenylyl cyclase → less cAMP
  * G<sub>αs</sub>: Inhibit Phosphodiesterase → more cAMP
  * GPCR / G<sub>αq</sub>: Phospholipase C Signal Transduction
