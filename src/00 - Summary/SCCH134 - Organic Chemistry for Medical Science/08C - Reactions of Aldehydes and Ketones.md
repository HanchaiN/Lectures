# Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones

* Reactivity
  * Steric Effect: Aldehyde is more reactive (Smaller substituent: $\ce{H}$)
  * Electronic Effect: Aldehyde is more reactive (High partial-positive charge at $\ce{C}$)
* Nucleophilic Addition $\ce{C=O ->\[Nu-,E+\] Nu-C-O-E}$ (Non-stereospecific)
  * Hydride ($\ce{H-}$→ Primary / Secondary Alcohol
    * Reagent
      * $\ce{LiAlH4}$ or $\ce{NaBH4}$ then $\ce{H3O+}$
        * Can form complex up to the number of $\ce{H-}$ in $\ce{MH\_{n}}$
        * Substitute $\ce{O-M}$ with $\ce{O-H}$ via $\ce{H3O+}$ or $\ce{H2O}$
      * $\ce{H2/Pd}$ or $\ce{H2/Pd}$ or $\ce{H2/Ni}$
  * Carbon Nucleophile ($\ce{R-}$)→ Secondary/Tertiary Alcohol
    * Reagent
      * Grignard Reagent $\ce{R-MgX}$ (then $\ce{H2O}$ to substitute $\ce{O-MgX}$)
      * Organolithium $\ce{R-Li}$
      * Sodium Alkynide $\ce{R-C#C^{-} Na^{+}}$
      * Sodium Cyanide $\ce{N#C^{-} Na^{+}}$
