# Classification and Structure of Hydrocarbons

* Aliphatic Hydrocarbons
  * Alkanes
  * Alkenes
    * Isolated Alkenes
    * Conjugated Alkenes
* Aromatic Compounds
  * Aromatic Hydrocarbon
  * Heteroatomic Compounds
  * Aromaticity (Hückel's rule for aromaticity)
    * Cyclic planar structure
    * Conjugated $\pi$-bond across the cycle
    * ($4n+2$) $\pi$-electrons in the conjugated system
    * Note:
      * $\pi$-bond with atoms outside the system count as valid part of the system but doesn't count the electrons since it cannot delocalize
      * Lone pair may or may not align and be a valid part of the system
