# Bonds and Shapes of molecules

* Bond
  * [Ionic Bonding](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Molecular%20Theory/Chemical%20Bonding/Ionic%20Bonding.md)
    * Transferred Electron → Ions (Electric Charges) → Attraction
    * Uncommon in Organic Chemistry (Carbon is unlikely to be an isolated ions, but compound ions are possible)
      * Carbocation, Carbanion (w/ [Formal Charge](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Molecular%20Theory/Chemical%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding/Formal%20Charge.md))
  * [Covalent Bonding](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Molecular%20Theory/Chemical%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding.md)
    * Octet Rule
    * $\sigma$-bond & $\pi$-bond (by shape)
    * Single bond & Double bond & Triple bond (by number of shared electrons)
      * Generally one $\sigma$-bond and the rest is $\pi$-bond
    * Polarity of covalent bond
      * [Electronegativity](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Atomic%20Theory/Property%20of%20Element/Electronegativity.md) (Pauling Scale of Electronegativity)
        * $\chi\_{\ce{F}}>\chi\_{\ce{O}}>\chi\_{\ce{N}}\approx\chi\_{\ce{Cl}}>\chi\_{\ce{Br}}>\chi\_{\ce{S}}\approx\chi\_{\ce{C}}$
      * [Bond Dipole Moment](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Molecular%20Theory/Chemical%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding/Bond%20Dipole%20Moment.md)
        * Molecular dipole moment: Directional Sum of Bond Dipole Moment
* Molecular Shapes
* [Formal Charge](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Molecular%20Theory/Chemical%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding/Formal%20Charge.md)
  * Cut bonds in half
  * Play role in Reaction Mechanism
    * May indicate with charge in circle $\oplus$, $\ominus$
