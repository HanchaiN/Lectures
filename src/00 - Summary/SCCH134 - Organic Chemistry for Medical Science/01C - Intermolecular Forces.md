# Intermolecular Forces

* [Ionic Bonding](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Physical%20Chemistry/Chemical%20Physics/Molecular%20Theory/Chemical%20Bonding/Ionic%20Bonding.md) (Electrostatic Attraction)
* Dipole-dipole Attraction
  * Charge attraction
* Van der Waals Attraction (Non-polar Interaction but may be possible in polar molecule)
  * London Dispersion Forces
  * Hydrophobic Interaction
  * Depends on molecular surface area (heuristically, molecular weight)
  * Temporary uneven charge distribution
* Hydrogen bonding
  * (Partially)-Positively charged Hydrogen & Atoms w/ high electronegativity & lone electron pair
  * Significantly weaker than [Covalent Bonding](../../01%20-%20Concept/Chemistry/Physical%20Chemistry/Chemical%20Physics/Molecular%20Theory/Chemical%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding.md) but stronger than dipole-dipole interaction
  * Amides > Carboxylic Acids > Alcohols > Amines

## Effects on mechanism of Biomolecules

* Drug targets at the molecular level
  * Drug ($\<\\pu{1000 amu}$)
  * Target: Macromolecules ($>\pu{1000 amu}$)
    * Enzyme, Receptor, Transport protein, Nucleic Acid
  * Binding site
    * Attraction and Repulsion causing (specific) binding
    * See pharmacodynamics for more
