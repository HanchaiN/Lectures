# Structures and Physical Properties of Carboxylic Acids

* Structure
  * Carboxylic Acid $\ce{R-COOH}$
  * Acid Anhydride $\ce{R-CO-O-CO-R}$
  * Ester $\ce{R-CO-OR}$
  * Amine
    * Primary $\ce{R-CO-NH2}$
    * Secondary $\ce{R-CO-NHR}$
    * Tertiary $\ce{R-CO-NR2}$
  * Acid Halides $\ce{R-CO-X}$
  * Nitrile $\ce{R-C#N}$ (No $\ce{-CO-}$ here)
    * Hydrolyze in acid to Primary Amine then Carboxylic Acid
  * Compared to Aldehydes and Ketones: $\ce{-CO-}$ is connected to heteroatom
* Physical Properties
  * High BP, MP (H-bond)
  * Water-soluble (H-bond)
