* Addition Reaction: $\ce{C=C + Y-Z -> C(Y)-C(Z)}$
  * By Mechanism
    * Electrophilic Addition: $\ce{C=C + E+ -> C(E)-C+}$
      * Stability of Carbocation
      * Possible Rearrangement
      * $\ce{C=C + H+ -> C(H)-C+ + C^{+}-C(H)}$
    * Radical Addition: $\ce{C=C + Rad. -> C(Rad)-C.}$
      * Stability of Carbon Radical
      * $\ce{C=C + Br. -> C(Br)-C. + C.-C(Br)}$  
        $\ce{C=C + HBr ->\[HO-OH -> HO. + .OH\]\[HO. + H-Br -> HOBr + H.; HO. + H-Br -> H2O + Br.\] C(H)-C. + C.-C(H) + C(Br)-C. + C.-C(Br)}$
    * Nucleophilic Addition: $\ce{C=C + Nu- -> C(Nu)-C-}$
      * Stability of Carbanion
      * $\ce{C=O + HCN ->\[HCN -> H+ + N#C^{-}\] N#C-C-O^{-} ->\[+ H+\] N#C-C-OH }$
  * By Stereochemistry: Syn- / Anti- / Non-stereospecific
  * Markovnikov's Rule: Stability of Ions/Radicals → $\ce{H}$ prefer $\ce{C}$ with more $\ce{H}$
    * Markovnikov Addition
    * Anti-Markovnikov Addition
* Elimination Reaction: $\ce{C(Y)-C(Z) -> C=C + Y-Z}$
  * By Stereochemistry: Syn- / Anti- / Non-stereospecific
  * Zaitsev's Rule: Prefer double bond with more substituents (experimental)
    * Stability of Alkene (Most stable to Least stable)  
      1. Tetrasubstituted Alkene $\ce{R2C=CR2}$  
      2. Trisubstituted Alkene $\ce{R2C=CHR}$  
      3. Disubstituted Alkene (Have multiple forms; May compare steric)
    * trans-Disubstituted Alkene $\ce{RHC=CHR}$
    * cis-Disubstituted Alkene $\ce{RHC=CHR}$
    * 1,2-Disubstituted Alkene $\ce{R2C=CH2}$  
      1. Monosubstituted Alkene $\ce{RHC=CH2}$  
      2. Ethylene $\ce{H2C=CH2}$
    * Zaitsev Elimination
    * Hofmann Elimination: Opposite (Steric Interaction)
      * Apply when Large Leaving Group and/or Alkali (Attacker)
* Substitution Reaction: $\ce{C-L + Z -> C-Z + L}$
  * By Mechanism
    * Radical Substitution: $\ce{C-H + Br2 ->\[Br2 + h\nu / \Delta -> 2 Br.\]\[H. + Br. -> HBr\] C-Br + HBr}$
    * Nucleophilic Substitution: $\ce{C-OH + Br- -> C-Br + H+}$
    * Electrophilic Substitution: $\ce{Ph-H + CH3Cl ->\[AlCl3\] Ph-CH3 + HCl}$
  * By Stereochemistry: Retention / Inversion / Non-stereospecific
* Rearrangement Reaction
  * Carbocation: $\ce{R3C-CH+-R \<=>> R2C+-CR2}$
    * Move to the next carbon to increase stability
    * 1,2-hydride-shift / 1,2-alkyl-shift
      * Alkyl shift can cause ring expansion which may stabilize the ring
    * Can shift multiple times (1,2-rearrangement at a time)
      * Greedy-ish: May shift if equal stability; May shift to unstable configuration to shift again to more stable configuration
  * Carbon radical and Carbanion is too reactive
    * Note: can still resonance to other locations
* Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
  * Oxidation Number (for $\ce{C}$)  
    1. Assume neutral (initial → 0)  
    2. Count bond with following (multiple bond count multiple times)  
    - Carbons → No Change  
    - Electropositive Atoms ($\ce{H}$, $\ce{M}$: Metals) → +1  
    - Electronegative atom ($\ce{O}$, $\ce{N}$, $\ce{S}$, $\ce{X}$: Halides) → -1
  * Oxidation ($\hat{o}$): Less Oxidation Number: More Electronegative Atoms
  * Reduction: More Oxidation Number: More Electropositive Atoms
* Major product
  * Stability of Intermediates
  * Multiplicity
  * Note: the weight of each factor depends on the selectivity/reactivity of reagent
