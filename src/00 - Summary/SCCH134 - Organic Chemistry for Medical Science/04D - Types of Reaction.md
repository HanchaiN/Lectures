    * Stability of Carbon Radical
    * $\ce{C=C + Br. -> C(Br)-C. + C.-C(Br)}$  
      $\ce{C=C + HBr ->\[HO-OH -> HO. + .OH\]\[HO. + H-Br -> HOBr + H.; HO. + H-Br -> H2O + Br.\] C(H)-C. + C.-C(H) + C(Br)-C. + C.-C(Br)}$

    * Stability of Carbanion
    * $\ce{C=O + HCN ->\[HCN -> H+ + N#C^{-}\] N#C-C-O^{-} ->\[+ H+\] N#C-C-OH }$
* (syn- / anti-) Elimination Reaction: $\ce{C(Y)-C(Z) -> C=C + Y-Z}$
  * Stereospecific vs non-stereospecific reaction
* Substitution Reaction: $\ce{C-L + Z -> C-Z + L}$
  * Radical Substitution: $\ce{C-H + Br2 ->\[Br2 + h\nu / \Delta -> 2 Br.\]\[H. + Br. -> HBr\] C-Br + HBr}$
  * Nucleophilic Substitution: $\ce{C-OH + Br- -> C-Br + H+}$
  * Electrophilic Substitution: $\ce{Ph-H + CH3Cl ->\[AlCl3\] Ph-CH3 + HCl}$
  * Aromatic Substitution: $\ce{Ar-L + Z ->\[\\text{catalyst}\] Ar-Z + L}$
* Rearrangement Reaction
  * Carbocation: $\ce{R3C-CH+-R \<=>> R2C+-CR2}$
    * Move to the next carbon to increase stability
    * 1,2-hydride-shift / 1,2-alkyl-shift
  * Carbon radical and Carbanion is too reactive
* Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
  * Oxidation Number (for $\ce{C}$)
    1. Assume neutral (initial → 0)
    1. Count bond with following (multiple bond count multiple times)
       * Carbons → No Change
       * Electropositive Atoms ($\ce{H}$, $\ce{M}$: Metals) → +1
       * Electronegative atom ($\ce{O}$, $\ce{N}$, $\ce{S}$, $\ce{X}$: Halides) → -1
  * Oxidation ($\hat{o}$): Less Oxidation Number: More Electronegative Atoms
  * Reduction: More Oxidation Number: More Electropositive Atoms
* Major product
  * Stability of Intermediates
  * Multiplicity
  * Note: the weight of each factor depends on the selectivity/reactivity of reagent
