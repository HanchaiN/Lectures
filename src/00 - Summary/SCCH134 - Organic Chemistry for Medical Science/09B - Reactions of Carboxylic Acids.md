# Reactions of Carboxylic Acids

* Acidity Reaction: $\ce{RCOOH + H2O \<=>\[K\_{a}\] RCOO^{-} + H3O+}$
  * Can ionize spontaneously
  * Inductive Effect vs Resonance Effect
    * Inductive: through bonds (EN)
      * Effect depends on distance
    * Resonance: delocalizing
      * Have stronger effect
      * Possibly via Conjugation system
      * ortho- / parahave more effect than metadespite the distance
    * EDG → Less Acidic & EWG → More Acidic
  * More acidic than phenol and alcohol (and water), resp.
    * Less resonance than phenol but negative charge goes to high EN
    * $\ce{NaH}$: $\ce{R-COOH}$, $\ce{Ar-OH}$, $\ce{R-OH}$
    * $\ce{NaOH}$: $\ce{R-COOH}$, $\ce{Ar-OH}$
    * $\ce{NaHCO3}$: $\ce{R-COOH}$
* Nucleophilic Substitution (Substitution of hydroxy group): $\ce{R-CO-X ->\[+ Nu\] R-C(X)(Nu)(O^{-}) ->\[- X-\] R-CO-Nu}$
  * See [Leaving Group Comparison](09B%20-%20Reactions%20of%20Carboxylic%20Acids.md#leaving-group-comparison)
    * Can substitute toward less reactive group
    * Going in reverse require reagents
      * $\ce{RCOOH ->\[SOCl2\] RCOCl}$
      * $\ce{RCOOH ->\[P2O5,\Delta\] R-CO-O-CO-R + H2O}$
  * Note: $\ce{Nu}$ may act as alkali and ionize $\ce{COX}$ instead
  * Mechanism: Addition (slow) + Elimination
  * Fisher Esterification (Acid-catalyzed Esterification): $\ce{R-COOH + R-OH \<=>\[H+,\Delta\] R-COOR + H2O}$
    * Protonation of carbonyl (resonate between $\ce{C=O^{+}H}$ and $\ce{C^{+}-OH}$)
    * Protonation of geminal diol (results in dehydration to carbonyl)
  * Nitrile Synthesis
    * $\ce{R-X + N#C^{-} ->\[S\_{N}2\] R-C#N}$
    * $\ce{R-CO-NH2 ->\[P2O5,\Delta\]\[- H2O\] R-C#N}$
  * Decarboxylation: $\ce{X-CO-CH2-CO-OH ->\[\\Delta\] X-CO-CH3 + CO2}$
    * $\ce{X-CO-CH2-CO-OH}$: $\beta$-keto acid / 1,3-dicarboxylic acid
  * Carboxylic Acid → Amide: Require Heat, Impractical

## Leaving Group Comparison

|Leaving Group|$pK\_{a}$|
|-------------|--------|
|$\ce{Cl-}$|$\pu{-7}$|
|$\ce{R-CO-O^{-}}$|$\pu{5}$|
|$\ce{RO^{-}}$|$\pu{16}$|
|$\ce{HO^{-}}$|$\pu{15.7}$|
|$\ce{H2N^{-}}$|$\pu{35}$|
|$\ce{H^{-}}$|$\pu{35}$|
|$\ce{R-}$|$\pu{45 - 50}$|

Note: $\ce{R-CO-OH ->\[Nu\] R-CO-Nu + OH-}$ yield less than $\ce{R-CO-OR ->\[Nu\] R-CO-Nu + OR-}$ due to protonation  
Note : $\ce{R-CO-H}$ is aldehyde and $\ce{R-CO-R}$ is ketone
