# Physical Properties

* Solubility
  * Depends on [Intermolecular Forces](01C%20-%20Intermolecular%20Forces.md)
  * like dissolves like
    * Hydrophilic
      * Ionic, Polar, H-bond
      * Alcohol with $\<5\ce{C}$
    * Hydrophobic
* Boiling Points
  * Depends on [Intermolecular Forces](01C%20-%20Intermolecular%20Forces.md)
* Melting Points
  * Depends on [Intermolecular Forces](01C%20-%20Intermolecular%20Forces.md)
  * Depends on Packing

## Effects on mechanism of Biomolecules

* Cellular Functions
  * Selective Membrane and Transport Protein
* Saturated fat (in triglyceride) will have higher melting point due to the orderly packing

## Reference

* Handout SCCH134
