  * Vertical Asymptote ($\pm\infty$)
* Technique for finding derivatives
  * Explicit differentiation vs Implicit differentiation
    * Explicit: $\displaystyle y=f(x)\implies\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$
    * Implicit: $\displaystyle f(x,y)=c\implies\frac{d}{dx}f(x,y)=\frac{d}{dx}c=0$
  * Logarithmic differentiation
    * $\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\ln y=\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}$
