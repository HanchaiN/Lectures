# Magnetism and Magnetic Field

* Magnet (bipolar)
  * No monopole
  * Like repels like
  * Require no medium
  * From spins / moving charges
  * Can induce re-alignment to ferromagnetic material, may results in permanent magnet
* Magnetic Field $\vec{B}$
  * Defined from North to South
  * Notation: cross = into plane; dots = out of plane
* Magnetic Force $\vec{F}=q\vec{v\_{q}}\times\vec{B}$
  * $1\text{ T}=1\text{ N}\text{ A}^{-1}\text{ m}^{-1}$
  * $10^{4}\text{ G}=1\text{ T}$
  * Circular/Spiral motion $r = \frac{mv\_{\perp}}{qB}$
* Electric Current $I=\frac{dQ}{dt}$ (through area)
  * $1\text{ A}=1\text{ C}\text{ s}^{-1}$
* Ohm's law $R = \frac{V}{I}$
  * Resistance $R$ ($\Omega$)
* Ampère's circuital law: current create magnetic field (right-hand rule)
  * Linear current → Circular magnet
  * Circular current → Linear magnet
* Lenz's law & Faraday's law: changed magnetic field create current
  * Lenz's law: current is opposing change
  * Faraday's law: quantitative explanation
