# Bacillus anthracis (Anthrax)

* Etymology
  * Bacillus: Little Rod
  * Anthracis: Coal
* Properties
  * Rod-shaped bacteria
  * Gram positive
  * Non-motile
  * Facultative anaerobe
  * Non $\beta$-Hemolytic
  * Spore forming
* Pathogenesis
  * Poly-D-Glutamic acid capsule
    * Anti-phagocytic
  * Release anthrax toxin
    * Free protein
    * Protective antigen
      * Binds w/ immune cell @ ANTXR1 (Tumor endothelial marker 8)
      * Open channel for Lethal factor & Edema factor to enters immune cells
    * Lethal factor
      * Zinc Metalloprotease
      * Zinc as cofactor
      * Cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 & 2
        * Inhibits NADPH synthesis (cofactor for ATP synthesis and others)
        * Inhibits ATP synthesis → Apoptosis
    * Edema factor
      * Causing Edema around black eschar
      * ADP Ribosyl-transferase
        * ATP → cAMP
        * Activating Protein kinase A → Regulation of cell functions
        * Perturb Cytokines (signal to call Leukocytes)
* Anthrax disease
  * Plagues, Biological warfare
  * Transmission @Skin / Lung / GI Tract
    * Cutaneous anthrax: Endospore on skin via hair/wool
      * Germinate locally → Painless papules → Vesicle → Vesicle ruptures → Dead tissue → Black skin lesion (Eschar)
    * Gastrointestinal anthrax: Undercooked meat w/ spores
      * Black Eschar in GI Tract
      * Abdominal pain, Nausea, Vomiting (likely w/ blood), Diarrhea (w/ or w/o blood)
  * Endospore endocytosed by macrophage
    * Spore germinated, Causing cytolysis, Releasing bacteria
    * Transported to lymph note, Destroy Immune cells
  * Necrosis → Bleeding → Organ failures, Septic Shock, Death

## Endosporulation

* Spore formation
* Threating environment: Too hot, Too cold, Too dry, Harmful radiation
* Steps
  * Replicate DNA
  * Forms cell wall
    * Large Mother cell, Small portion
  * Plasma membrane surround and exocytosis new DNA from small portion
    * Forespore
  * Forespore endocytosis into mother cell
  * Forespore loses water, accumulate calcium, wrapped in cortex
    * Dying mother cell synthesize cortex
    * Forespore → Endospore
    * Dipicolinic acid in core of spore → Heat, Chemicals, Digestive enzymes, Antibiotics resistance
  * Endospore released from dead mother cell
  * Endospore germinate into bacterial / vegetative form
