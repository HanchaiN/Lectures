# Host-Microbe Interaction

* Forms of host-microbe relationship
  * Mutualism / Commensalism / Parasitism
* Microbiome: Genome of Microorganisms (Overall)
  * Commensal / Probiotics
  * Pathogens
* Microbiota: Microorganisms by taxonomy (Each microbe)
* Each sites â†’ Each groups of microbes
* Probiotics: Live beneficial bacteria (in gut)
  * Early Colonization
    * First 1000 days of life
    * Gut Health
    * Intergenerationally Transferred
  * Dysbiosis: Imbalanced microbiome
    * Nutrients / Drugs / Immunity / Intestinal mucosa
    * Diets / Fecal Microbiota Transplant / Probiotics Ingestion
    * Prebiotics: Nutrients for Probiotic
    * Postbiotics: Metabolites produced by Probiotics
* Pathogen
  * Immune Response (Host) vs Virulence Factor (Microbe)
  * Infection  
    1. Transmission  
    - Route  
    - Respiratory  
    - Oral  
    - Direct Contact (Skin lesion / Wound)  
    - Biting (Arthropod / Canine / Feline)  
    - Vertical (Mother to Baby)  
    - Sexual  
    - Contagious  
    - Basic Reproduction Number $R\_{0}$  
    - new cases per one case (assume no immunity)  
    - Fatality  
    2. Establishment  
    - Sites  
    - Respiratory  
    - Alimentary  
    - Placenta  
    - Skin  
    - Urogenital  
    - Cellular Level  
    - Extracellular: Colonization  
    - Biofilm Formation  
    - Helminths Attachment  
    - Intracellular: Receptor / Entry  
    3. Replication and Survival  
    4. Dissemination (Spread)  
    5. Causing Damage (Disease / Clinical phase)  
    - Time  
    - Incubation Period: Pre-disease  
    - Recovery Period: Post-disease  
    - Period of communicability: clinical phase + (partial) pre- / post-  
    - Latent period: Before Period of communicability  
    - Pattern  
    - Acute, self-limited  
    - Acute + Latent + periodic reactivation  
    - Acute + Chronic  
    - Acute + Persistent + overproduction  
    - Chronic  
    - Direct  
    - Cytopathic Effect  
    - Cell Death / Tissue Injuries  
    - Transformation  
    - Indirect  
    - Bacterial Toxin  
    - Immune-mediated Damage
