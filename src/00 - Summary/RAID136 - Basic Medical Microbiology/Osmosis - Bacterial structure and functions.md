# Bacterial structure and functions

* Structure
  * Prokaryotic
    * No nucleus
    * No Membrane bound organelles
      * No Mitochondria
      * No Endoplasmic Reticulum
      * No Golgi Complexes
  * Cell Envelope
    * Capsule
      * Protection again phagocytosis
      * Adhesion to surfaces
      * Virulence factor
    * Cell wall
      * Protection: Peptidoglycan
        * Gram positive: Thick peptidoglycan above plasma membrane
          * Can retain straining dye
        * Gram negative: Thin peptidoglycan between surface membrane & plasma membrane
      * Maintain Shape
        * Cocci: Round shaped
        * Bacilli: Rod shaped
        * Spirilla: Spiral shaped
        * Pleomorphic: Multiple shape
    * Plasma membrane: Enclose Cytoplasm
      * Acquire nutrients, Eliminate waste
      * Maintain Homeostasis (constant organized state)
      * Selectively permeable barrier (usually)
      * Respiration, Photosynthesis, Synthesis of lipids and cell wall
  * Cytoplasm
    * Ribosome: Protein synthesis
      * Cytoplasmic / Plasma-membraneâ€“associated
    * Nucleoid: Chromosome
      * Mostly single, Mostly circular, double-stranded DNA
    * Plasmids: Independent Small linear/circular ds-DNA
      * Few genes, Non-essential but provide selective advantage
  * Pili & Fimbriae: Attachment to surfaces
    * Fimbriae is shorter than Pilli
  * Flagella: Movement
* Disease / Microbiota
  * Can exists inside body / on external surfaces
