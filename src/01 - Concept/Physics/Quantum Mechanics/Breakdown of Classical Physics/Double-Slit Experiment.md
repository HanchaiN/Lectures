# Double-Slit Experiment

* Wave Behavior of Matter: Self-interference of electron
* Classical Wave: Diffract around slits and interfere with instance of the same wave from the different slit causing the interference pattern.
* Classical Particle: May diffract but cannot interfere with itself.
* Quantum Particle: Somehow causing the interference pattern â†’ Must interfere with itself.  
  - One particle will lands on just one point but together forms a clear distribution like that of the interference pattern.
