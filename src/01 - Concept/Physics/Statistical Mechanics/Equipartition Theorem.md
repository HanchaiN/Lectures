# Equipartition Theorem

In [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium"), energy is shared equally among all of its various forms

$$
\\left\langle x\_{m}\frac{\partial H}{\partial x\_{n}}\right\rangle=\delta\_{mn}k\_{B}T
$$

* For quadratic degree of freedom $H\_{n}=a\_{n}x\_{n}^{2}$, expected energy distributed in the degree of freedom is $\left\langle H\_{n}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2}k\_{B}T$.
