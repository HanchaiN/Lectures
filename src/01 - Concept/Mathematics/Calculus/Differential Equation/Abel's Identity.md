# Abel's Identity

For second-order [Homogeneous LDE](Homogeneous%20Linear%20Differential%20Equation.md) $y^{\prime\prime}+p y^{\prime}+q y = 0$ on an interval of the real line with real-valued or complex-valued continuous functions $p$ and $q$, the [Wronskian](Wronskian.md) $W(y\_{1},y\_{2})$ of two real-valued or complex-valued solutions $y\_{1}$ and $y\_{2}$ of this differential equation satisfies

$$
W\left(y\_{1},y\_{2}\right)\left(x\right)=W\left(y\_{1},y\_{2}\right)\left(x\_{0}\right)\cdot e^{-\int\_{x\_{0}}^{x}p(t)dt}
$$
