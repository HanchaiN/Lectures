# System of Linear Differential Equations

(First-order)

$$
y_{i}^{\prime}=L\left[y_{1},\dots,y_{n}\right]
$$

for $i=1,\dots,n$ and $L$ is a [[Linear Transformation|Linear]] operator

Alternatively, $\mathbf{y}^{\prime}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{y}+\mathbf{b}$.

The equations can be reduced into sets of independent [[Linear Differential Equation]] and the solutions of one will correspond to solutions of the other.
