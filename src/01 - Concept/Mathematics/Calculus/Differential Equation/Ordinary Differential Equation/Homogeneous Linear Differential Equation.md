# Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation

$$
L\[y\]=\sum\limits\_{i=0}^{n}a\_{i}(t)y^{(i)}(t)=0
$$

where $L$ is a [Linear](../../../Linear%20Transformation.md) differential operator

* There are $n$ linearly-independent solutions for $n$-th order [Homogeneous LDE](Homogeneous%20Linear%20Differential%20Equation.md).
* The final solution can be solved using the [Wronskian](Wronskian.md)
