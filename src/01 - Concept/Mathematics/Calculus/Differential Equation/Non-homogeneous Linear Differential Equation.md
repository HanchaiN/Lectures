# Non-homogeneous Linear Differential Equation

$$
L\left\[y\right\]=\sum\limits\_{i=0}^{n}a\_{i}(t)y^{(i)}(t)=g(t)\ne0
$$

* The general solution is $y\_{c}+y\_{p}$ where
  * Complementary function ($y\_{c}$) is the solutions of $L\[y\] = 0$ ([Homogeneous LDE](Homogeneous%20Linear%20Differential%20Equation.md)).
  * Particular integral ($y\_{p}$) is a solution of the equation.

## Solving Technique

* [Variation of Parameter](Variation%20of%20Parameter.md) (for $a\_{i}\sim\text{const.}$)
