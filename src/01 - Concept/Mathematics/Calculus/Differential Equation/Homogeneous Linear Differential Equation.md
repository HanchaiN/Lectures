# Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation

$$
L\[y\]=\sum\limits\_{i=0}^{n}a\_{i}(t)y^{(i)}(t)=0
$$

where $L$ is a [Linear](../../Linear%20Transformation.md) differential operator

* There are $n$ linearly-independent solutions for $n$-th order [Homogeneous LDE](Homogeneous%20Linear%20Differential%20Equation.md).
  * Superposition Principle: If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions of the [Homogeneous LDE](Homogeneous%20Linear%20Differential%20Equation.md), their linear combinations (i.e. $c\_{1}y\_{1}+c\_{2}y\_{2}$) are also solutions of the same DE.
  * The final solution can be solved using the [Wronskian](Wronskian.md).
