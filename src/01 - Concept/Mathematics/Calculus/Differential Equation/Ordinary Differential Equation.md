# Ordinary Differential Equation

Single independent variable

$$
F\left(t,y,y^{\prime},\dots,y^{(n)}\right)=0
$$where $u^{\prime}=\frac{d}{dt}u$ and $u^{(n)}=\frac{d^{n}}{dt^{n}}u$.

Can be rewritten as first-order [System of Ordinary Differential Equations](System%20of%20Differential%20Equation/System%20of%20Ordinary%20Differential%20Equations.md) by let $y\_{i}=y\_{i-1}^{\prime}=y^{(i)}$ and $y\_{0}=y$.
