# Hydrogen Bonding

* (Partially)-Positively charged Hydrogen & Lone Electron Pair of Atoms w/ high [Electronegativity](../../../Atomic%20Theory/Property%20of%20Element/Electronegativity.md)
  * Partially-Positively charged Hydrogen: Bonds with atoms w/ high [Electronegativity](../../../Atomic%20Theory/Property%20of%20Element/Electronegativity.md)
  * Atoms w/ high [Electronegativity](../../../Atomic%20Theory/Property%20of%20Element/Electronegativity.md): e.g. $\ce{F}$, $\ce{O}$, $\ce{N}$
* Significantly weaker than [Covalent Bonding](../Intramolecular%20Interaction/Covalent%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding.md) but stronger than [Dipole-Dipole Attraction](Dipole-Dipole%20Attraction.md)
