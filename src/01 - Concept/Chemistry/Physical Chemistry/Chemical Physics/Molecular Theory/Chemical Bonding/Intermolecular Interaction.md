# Intermolecular Interaction

* [Electrostatic Attraction](Intramolecular%20Interaction/Ionic%20Bonding.md)
* Dipole-dipole Attraction
  * Charge attraction
* Van der Waals Attraction (Non-polar Interaction but may be possible in polar molecule)
  * London Dispersion Forces
  * Hydrophobic Interaction
  * Depends on molecular surface area (heuristically, molecular weight)
  * Temporary uneven charge distribution
* Hydrogen bonding
  * (Partially)-Positively charged Hydrogen & Atoms w/ high *Elect* & lone electron pair
  * Significantly weaker than [Covalent Bonding](Intramolecular%20Interaction/Covalent%20Bonding/Covalent%20Bonding.md) but stronger than dipole-dipole interaction
