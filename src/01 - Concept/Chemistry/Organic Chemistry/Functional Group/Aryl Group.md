* HÃ¼ckel's rule for aromaticity
  * [Cyclic](Cyclic%20Hydrocarbon.md) planar structure
  * Conjugated $\pi$-bond across the cycle
    * $\pi$-bond with atoms outside the system count as valid part of the system
    * Lone pair may or may not align and be a valid part of the system
  * ($4n+2$) $\pi$-electrons in the conjugated system
    * Electrons in the $\pi$-bond with atoms outside the system doesn't since it cannot delocalize.
