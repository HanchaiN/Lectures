# Elimination Reaction

$$
\\ce{C(Y)-C(Z) -> C=C + Y-Z}
$$

* By Stereochemistry: Syn- / Anti- / Non-stereospecific
* Zaitsev's Rule: Prefer double bond with more substituents (experimental data)
  * Zaitsev Elimination
  * Hofmann Elimination: Opposite (Steric Interaction)
    * Apply when Large Leaving Group and/or Alkali (Attacker)
