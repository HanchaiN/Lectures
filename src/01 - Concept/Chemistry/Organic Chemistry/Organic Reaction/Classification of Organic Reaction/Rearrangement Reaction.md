# Rearrangement Reaction

$$
\\ce{R3C-CH+-R \<=>> R2C+-CR2}
$$

* [Carbocation](../Reaction%20Component/Carbocation.md)
* Move cation to the next carbon to increase stability
* 1,2-hydride-shift / 1,2-alkyl-shift  
  - Alkyl shift can cause ring expansion which may stabilize the ring
* Can shift multiple times (1,2-rearrangement at a time)  
  - Greedy-ish: May shift if equal stability; May shift to unstable configuration to shift again to more stable configuration
* [Carbon Radical](../Reaction%20Component/Carbon%20Radical.md) and [Carbanion](../Reaction%20Component/Carbanion.md) is too reactive
