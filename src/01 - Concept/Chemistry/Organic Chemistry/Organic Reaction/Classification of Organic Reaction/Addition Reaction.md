# Addition Reaction

$$
\\ce{C=C + Y-Z -> C(Y)-C(Z)}
$$

* By Mechanism
  * Electrophilic Addition: $\ce{C=C + E+ -> C(E)-C+}$
    * Stability of Carbocation
    * Possible Rearrangement
  * Radical Addition: $\ce{C=C + Rad. -> C(Rad)-C.}$
    * Stability of Carbon Radical
  * Nucleophilic Addition: $\ce{C=C + Nu- -> C(Nu)-C-}$
    * Stability of Carbanion
* By Stereochemistry: Syn- / Anti- / Non-stereospecific
* Markovnikov's Rule: Stability of Ions/Radicals â†’ $\ce{H}$ prefer $\ce{C}$ with more $\ce{H}$
  * Markovnikov Addition
  * Anti-Markovnikov Addition
