* [Elimination Reaction](Classification%20of%20Organic%20Reaction/Elimination%20Reaction.md)
* [Substitution Reaction](Classification%20of%20Organic%20Reaction/Substitution%20Reaction.md)
* [Rearrangement Reaction](Classification%20of%20Organic%20Reaction/Rearrangement%20Reaction.md)
* Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
  * Oxidation Number (for $\ce{C}$)  
    1. Assume neutral (initial → 0)  
    2. Count bond with following (multiple bond count multiple times)  
    - Carbons → No Change  
    - Electropositive Atoms ($\ce{H}$, $\ce{M}$: Metals) → +1  
    - Electronegative atom ($\ce{O}$, $\ce{N}$, $\ce{S}$, $\ce{X}$: Halides) → -1
  * Oxidation ($\hat{o}$): Less Oxidation Number: More Electronegative Atoms
  * Reduction: More Oxidation Number: More Electropositive Atoms
