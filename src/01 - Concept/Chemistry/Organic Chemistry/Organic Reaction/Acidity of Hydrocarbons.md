# Acidity of Hydrocarbons

$$
\\ce{C-H \<=> C- + H+}
$$

* $\ce{R#CH} > \ce{R2C=CHR} > \ce{CHR3}$
  * Stability of [Carbanion](Reaction%20Component/Carbanion.md)
  * $\ce{R#CH}$ is just acidic enough for $\ce{NaNH2}$ ($\ce{NaOH}$ and $\ce{NaOEt}$ is not enough)
* Starting Material: [Alkane](../Functional%20Group/Alkyl%20Group.md) / [Alkene](../Functional%20Group/Alkenyl%20Group.md) / [Alkyne](../Functional%20Group/Alkynyl%20Group.md)
