# Regulation of Translation and Protein Synthesis

- Transcription: DNA → mRNA
- Translation: mRNA → Polypeptides → Proteins
	- 3 Nucleotides = 1 Codon → 1 Amino Acid
		- $\ce{4^{3}}$ codons → $20+1$ Amino Acid
			- Degeneracy: 1 Amino Acid ← Multiple Codons (Synonymous Codons)
		- Sense Codon: on mRNA (Mostly universal)
			- Start Codon: AUG: Methionine
			- Stop Codon: UAA, UAG, UGA: Nonsense
			- Exceptions: Uncommon Amino Acids / Different association
		- Aniticodon: on tRNA (pairs with sense codon)
	- 5'-to-3' of mRNA → Amine-terminus–to–Carboxyl-Terminus
		- $\ce{H2-[N^{(+)}H-CRH-CO]_{n}O- ->[H3N+-CRH-COO-] H2-[N^{(+)}H-CRH-CO]_{n+1}O-}$
	- Protein Folding
		- Folding begins as soon as section of polypeptides forms
		- Side-chains dictates folding
		- Chaperone (Assist)
		- Secondary Structure: $\alpha$-helix & $\beta$-sheet
			- $\ce{H}$-bond
			- Unfolded structure are free to move (irregular)
		- Tertiary Structure
			- Irregular section aligns to maximize stability
			- Hydrophobic Interaction
			- Ionic Interaction
			- Van der Waals Interaction
		- Quaternary Structure (Optional)
			- Binds with another folded polypeptide
	- Protein Functions
		- Cell shape & Organization
		- Transport
		- Movement
		- Cell Signaling
		- Cell surface recognition
		- Enzyme
