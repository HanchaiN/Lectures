# Protein structure and concept of bio-catalysis and enzyme kinetics

## Amino Acid

- Building block of proteins
	- Polymerization
		- Peptide bond (Amine + Carboxylic Acid → Amide)
	- Chirality
		- Chiral central tetrahedral $\alpha$-carbon
		- Usually L-configured
	- Various Sidechains
- Classification
	- Polarity of Sidechains: Hydrophobic / Acidic / Basic
	- Essential / Conditionally Non-Essential / Non-Essential
	- Uncommon Amino Acids: Derivatives
- Acid-Base: Weak polyprotic
	- $pK_{1}$: Carboxyl Group ($\ce{R-COOH <=>> R-COO- + H+}$)
	- $pK_{2}$: Amino Group ($\ce{R-NH3+ <<=> R-NH2 + H+}$)
	- $pK_\ce{R}$: Depends on side chain
	- Neutrally Zwitterion Form (Ammonium + Carboxylate)
	- Protonation / Deprotonation threshold: $pH = pK$
	- Isoelectric Point $pI$: $pH$ where molecule is neutrally charged
		- Usually, middle between two neighboring threshold ($pK$)
- Protein Purification
	- Ion-exchange chromatography: require $pI - pH = \pm 1$
	- Biosensors

## Protein

- $\pu{>50 \%}$ of cell's dry weight
- Classification
	- Shape
		- Fibrous Proteins
			- Simple, Regular, Insoluble, Linear, Structural Role
		- Globular Proteins
			- Spherical, Compact, Soluble, Cytosolic Function
		- Membrane Proteins
			- Soluble, Membrane System
	- Organization
		- Primary Structure: Amino Acids Sequence
			- Covalent Bonding (Peptide Bonds)
		- Secondary Structure: Regular sub-structures
			- Alpha Helix (Parallel / Anti-parallel)
			- Beta Sheet ($\frac{11}{3}\approx3.6$ AA per revolution)
			- Hydrogen Bonds (Backbones)
		- Tertiary Structure: Three-dimensional Structure
			- Hydrophobic Interaction (Hydrophobic Sidechain)
			- Sidechain Interactions
				- Disulfide Bridges: Covalent Bonding
		- Quaternary Structure: Complex of protein molecules
			- More Stability
			- Genetic Efficiency (Require less polypeptide → less genes)
			- Completion of Catalytic Sites
			- Cooperativity (Activate / Inhibit)
- Examples
	- Collagen: Triple Helix: Helical structure from 3 polypeptides
	- Hemoglobin: 2 $\alpha$-like globin ($\alpha$, $\zeta$) + 2 $\beta$-like globin ($\varepsilon$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\beta$)
		- Defective $\alpha$ globin → $\alpha$-Thalassemia and …($\beta$)
		- Fetal: $\beta$-like → $\delta$ globin
		- Oxygen-binding curves (Hemoglobin / Myoglobin)

## Enzymes

- Catalysts of Life
	- Lower activation (free) energy → More molecule have enough energy
	- Increase rxn rate by 14-26 order of magnitude
	- Specificity: Active Site
	- Regulation: Activator / Inhibitor
		- Allosteric Regulation
			- Regulator Binding (not at active site)
		- Covalent Modification
			- Phosphorylation
		- Proteolytic Cleavage
			- Require Cleavage to activate
- Nomenclature
	- Oxidoreductase (Redox)
	- Transferase (transfer functional groups)
	- Hydrolase (Hydrolysis)
	- Lyase (Bond Cleavage, non redox, non hydrolysis)
	- Isomerase (Isomerization)
	- Ligase (Bond with ATP cleavage)
- Mostly Protein
	- RNA → Ribozyme
	- Cofactors: Components essential to enzyme activity
	- Coenzymes: Organic Cofactors
		- TTP / FAD / NAD / CoA
	- Holoenzyme: Catalytically active complex of proteins and prosthetic group
	- Apoenzyme: Protein without prosthetic group (usually inactive)
