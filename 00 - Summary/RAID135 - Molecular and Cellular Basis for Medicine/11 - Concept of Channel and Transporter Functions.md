# Concept of Channel and Transporter Functions

- Channels
	- Physiological conditions → Conformational change → Diffusion
	- Non-gated: leak channel: specificity, always open
	- Gated: Voltage / Ligand
	- Physically gated: Mechanical / Thermal; TRP channel: Transient Receptor Potential Channel
- Voltage-gated Channel
	- Resting (Closed) / Open (Active) / Refractory (Inactivated)
	- Activation gate: Voltage-dependent
	- Inactivation gate: Time-dependent → Refractory period (Optional)
- Nerve Impulse
	- Resting: $\ce{Na+}$ closed, $\ce{K+}$ closed
	- Threshold: $\ce{Na+}$ open (partial; influx), $\ce{K+}$ closed
	- Depolarization: $\ce{Na+}$ open (influx), $\ce{K+}$ closed
	- Repolarization: $\ce{Na+}$ inactivated, $\ce{K+}$ open (outflux)
	- Undershoot: $\ce{Na+}$ inactivated, $\ce{K+}$ open (outflux)
	- Recovery: $\ce{Na+}$ closed, $\ce{K+}$ closed, Leaks
