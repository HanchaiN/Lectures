# DNA Replication, DNA Damage & Repair and Cell Cycle

## Cell Cycle

- Quiescent (G0)
    - Not actively preparing cell division
    - After M, Some cells can return to G1
- Interphase
    - Gap / Growth (G1)
        - Accumulating Resources and Energy
    - Synthesis (S)
        - DNA Replication → Sister Chromatids (attached at centromere)
        - Duplicate Microtubule-organizing Structure (Centrosome)
    - Gap / Growth (G2)
        - Re-organize Cytoplasm
        - Duplicate Organelles and Synthesize Proteins
- Mitotic Phase (M)
    - Karyokinesis / Mitosis: Separate DNA, Cytoplasm
        - Prophase
            - Centrioles and Spindle Fibers
            - Chromatin → (Condensed) Chromosome
        - Prometaphase
            - Nuclear Envelope Dissolves
            - Spindle fibers attach kinetochore (at Centromere)
        - Metaphase
            - Alignment of Chromosomes
        - Anaphase
            - Sister Chromatids Split and pulled
        - Telophase
            - Nuclear Envelope Reforms
    - Cytokinesis: Separate Cytosol
- Meiosis
    - G1 S G2 M1 M2
    - Meiosis I (M1)
        - Prophase I
            - Chromosome aligns with Homologue partner → Crossing Over
        - Metaphase I
            - Maternal / Paternal Chromosomes can independently assorted either resulting cell
        - Separation of Homologous Chromosome (Sister Chromatids attached)
    - Meiosis II (M2): ~Mitosis
    - Oogenesis → 1 functional oocyte + 3 degenerating polar body
        - Oogonium → Oocyte(Meiosis) → Mature Oocyte + polar body
        - Primary oocyte: meiotic arrest at prophase I
    - Spermatogenesis → 4 functional sperms
        - Spermatoponium → Spermatocyte(Meiosis) → Spermatid → Sperm
    - Aneuploidy: Abnormal number of chromosomes
        - Generally from error during maternal meiosis
        - e.g. Trisomy 21: Down Syndrome

## Cell Cycle Control System

- Regulate w/ 3 main transition points / Checkpoints
- Regulators
    - Positive Regulators: Progress to next phase
        - Cyclins
            - Cyclin Expression Cycle correlate w/ Cell Cycle Checkpoints
            - Decline in cyclin levels after checkpoint
            - ![Cyclin\_Expression.svg|500](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Cyclin_Expression.svg)
        - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
            - Exists throughout cell cycle (relatively stable level)
            - Require Cyclins (and, later, Phosphorylation) to activate
            - Will Phosphorylate other functional proteins
    - Negative Regulators: Halt the cycle
        - Retinoblastoma protein (Rb)
            - G1 checkpoint (block S-phase & cell growth)
                - Inhibit transcription factor
            - Tumor Suppressor
                - Damage / Non-functional → Cell cycle deregulation → Cancer (Uncontrollable replication)
        - p53
            - G1/S and G2/M checkpoints
                - Trigger CDK Inhibitor proteins (CKI)
                - Activate DNA Repair Enzymes
                - Trigger Programmed Cell Death
            - Tumor Suppressor
                - Non-functional → Proliferation of damaged (stressed) cells
                - One of the most commonly lost / mutated ($>\pu{50 \%}$ of all tumors)
        - p21
            - CDK inhibitor (CKI)
                - Less likely to move to S phase (G1/S)
                - Targeted by p53
- External Factors: Trigger Interface (from G0)
    - Growth Hormone
    - Death of nearby cell
    - Cell size
- Internal Checkpoints: Avoid Errors in cell duplication
    - G1/S Checkpoint (Restriction point)
        - Cell Size, Nutrients
        - DNA Integrity
    - G2 Checkpoint
        - DNA Damage
        - Replication Completeness
        - Trigger DNA Repair, Apoptosis, or Senescence
    - M Checkpoint (Spindle Checkpoint)
        - All Sister Chromatids attached to spindle microtubules
