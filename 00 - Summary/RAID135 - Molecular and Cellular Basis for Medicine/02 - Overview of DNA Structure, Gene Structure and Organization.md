# Overview of DNA Structure, Gene Structure and Organization

- DNA: Information
	- Store: for cellular function via RNA-protein
	- Reproduce: for offspring via replication
- Structure
	- Basic unit: 2 complementary polynucleotide chain
		- Generally 4 types (2 pairs) of nucleotides
		- Nitrogen containing base + sugar → Nucleoside
		- Nucleoside phosphate(s) → Nucleotide
		- Nucleotide: Phosphodiester (covalent) bonding
		- Strands: Hydrogen bonding
	- Double Helix
		- Anti-parallel from 5' (Phosphate) to 3' (Hydroxy)
		- 10bp per turn
		- $\ce{A=T;G#C}$ (replace $\ce{T}$ with $\ce{U}$ for RNA)
		- Maintaining; Assist Replication
- (Human) Genome
	- Genes can be on either strand of DNA
		- 24000 genes for human
		- Only some (30%) genes are expressed at a time (per cell)
	- Arranged in 2 sets (diploid) of 22 autosomes + sex chromosome
		- Each set from each parent
		- 3000 mil. bp. per haploid
	- Chromosome
		- 250 mil. bp. / 2000 genes per chromosome
		- Length approx. $\pu{3 m}$; nucleus size approx. $\pu{10 \micro m}$
		- Numbered from large to small
	- DNA + Protein → Nucleosome
		- Protein: Access Control & Packing
		- Histone + non-histone Proteins
			- 8 Histone core: 2x H2A, 2x H2B, 2x H3, 2x H4
		- N-terminal of histone can be modified to restructure chromosome
	- Packed Chain of Nucleosome → Chromatin
		- Condensed Chromosome during mitosis
		- Can relax for transcription / replication
	- After replication before division: 2 sister chromatid per chromosome
	- locus (plu. loci): location of gene on chromosome
	- allele: variant form of a gene
	- Most genomic DNA are non-coding
		- Coding DNA: for protein synthesis
			- Only 1% of genomic DNA (as exon)
			- Codon = 3 bases → 1 AA
		- junk DNA: no biological function
		- Non-coding DNA
			- Transcriptional Regulation (promoter / enchanter / etc)
			- Origin of Replication
			- Centromere / Telomere
			- Non-coding RNA (rRNA / tRNA / miRNA / etc)
	- Mitochondrial DNA
		- ~1700bp; 37genes; circular chromosome
		- Inherited via maternal egg cell
		- up to 2000 mitochondria per cell
		- Mitochondrial DNA polymerase
		- Mutation → Human disease → Mitochondrial transfer as treatment
	- 99.99% similarity among human populations
		- Polymorphism: multiple alleles
			- Generally single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
			- Once every 1000 bp → 3mil. SNP
			- Generally at gene, intron, non-coding region
		- Repetitive copy with number variant
			- Microsatellite: Copy 1-6bp; 5-50 times
				- Trinucleotide repeat → May cause genetic disorder
				- Identification in forensic medicine
			- Minisatellite: Copy 10-60 bp; 5-50 times
				- > 1000 locations in genomes (telomere)
			- Copy Number Variant: >1000 bp: gene / chromosome segment
			- Tandem (Same area) / Interspersed (Scattered copies) Repeat
- Epigenetic
