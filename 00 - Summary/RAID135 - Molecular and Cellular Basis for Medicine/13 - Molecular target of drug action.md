# Molecular target of drug action

- Drug Targets
	- Specific
		- Receptors
			- Extracellular
			- Intracellular
		- Other Targets
			- Ligands
			- Proteins
			- Nucleic Acids
			- Cell Components
	- Non-Specific
		- Physico-chemical properties
- Xenobiotic: substances that not normally present / produced
- Drug: Substances w/ Biological Effect
	- Drug action: Mechanism that drug produce response
		- Modify physiological effect (existing pathway)
		- Cannot create new pathway
- Receptors: Protein that bind w/ specific ligand
	- Extracellular
		- G Protein-Coupled Receptor (G<sub>s</sub> / G<sub>i</sub> / G<sub>q</sub> / PAR) \*
		- Ligand-gated ion channel (Cation / Anion) \*
		- Enzyme-linked receptor (RTK / GC-linked)
	- Intracellular
		- Nuclear Receptor
		- Ligand-gated ion channel on Organelle
