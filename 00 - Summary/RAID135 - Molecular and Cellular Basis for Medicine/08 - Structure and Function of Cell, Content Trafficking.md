# Structure and Function of Cell, Content Trafficking

- Cells: organism; organisms = cell / aggregated cells
	- Basic functional unit; Can individually perform process of life
- Cell Membrane
	- Physical isolation, structural support
	- Regulation of exchange, communication
	- Fluid mosaic model: phospholipid bilayers w/ integral protein
		- Cholesterol (mixed w/ phospholipid bilayers)
		- Sphingolipid (+ Carbohydrates → Glycolipids)
		- Proteins (+ Carbohydrates → Glycoproteins)
			- Membrane-spanning $\alpha$-helix ($\approx$ 20 AA)
				- Single / multiple / half-way
			- Covalently bonded w/ phospholipid (w/ or w/o oligosaccharide)
			- Intermolecularly bonded w/ integral protein
- Nucleus
	- DNA Storage
	- Nuclear Envelope
	- Nuclear Pore
	- Nucleolus: Ribosomal RNA synthesis
- Cytosol: Intracellular fluid
- Inclusions: insoluble particles aka non-membranous organelles
	- Ribosome
		- Fixed ribosome: attached to organelles' membrane → export
		- Free ribosome: in cytosol → cellular function
- Insoluble protein fibers: aka cytoskeleton
	- Shape, Movement
	- Tissue Assembly, Internal Organization, Intracellular Transport
	- Microfilament: actin (globular), $\diameter = \pu{7 nm}$
		- Motor protein: Myosin Fiber + Actin fiber → Muscle contraction
	- Intermediate filament: keratin, neurofilament (filaments), $\diameter = \pu{10 nm}$
	- Microtubules: tubulin (globular), $\diameter = \pu{25 nm}$
		- Centrioles: DNA movement during cell division
		- Cilia
			- hairlike
			- upper airway, female reproductive tract
			- 9 pairs + 2 central
		- Flagella
			- Longer cilia
			- free-floating single cells
		- Motor protein: Kinesin / Dyneins → vesicle along microtubules
- Organelles: membrane-bound compartment w/ role in cellular function
	- Mitochondria
		- Energy production
		- Apoptosis (Program cell death)
		- Inner / Outer membrane
		- Mitochondrial matrix: enzymes, ribosomes, DNA
		- Intermembrane space → ATP production
	- Endoplasmic Reticulum: Synthesis, Storage, Transport biomolecules
		- Smooth ER: Fatty acids, Steroids, Lipid
			- Liver, Kidney → Detoxify / Inactivate drug
			- Skeletal muscle → $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ storage
		- Rough ER: Protein (Enzymes, Hormones)
			- w/ Ribosome outside; synthesized protein inside
			- Post-translational modification @ ER lumen
	- Golgi apparatus: Modify, Package proteins from Rough ER
		- Glycosylation, Sulfation, Phosphorylation, Proteolysis
		- *cis* Golgi → medial Golgi → *trans* Golgi
		- Input: Transport vesicle from ER
		- Output: Lysosome / Storage Vesicle / Secretory Vesicle
			- Marked w/ Mannose-6-phosphate → Lysosome
		- Vesicle-fusion pathway
			- Constitutive pathway: continuous, unregulated
			- Regulated pathway: stored, release on signaled
				- Fast response, Energy consuming
	- Lysosome: digestive
		- From Golgi, enzyme-storage vesicle
		- Acidic, Degradative enzymes, Acid hydrolases
		- Gaucher syndrome (Type I): glucosylceramidase deficiency → glucosylceramide lipidosis (specific lipid excess) → spleen enlargement, bone pain
		- Autophagy: destruction of damaged organelles and components
			- Less function by aging
	- Peroxisome: digestive (long-chain fatty acids, purine; AMP, GMP)
		- From ER, enzyme-storage vesicle
		- Hydrogen peroxide detoxification (catalase)
		- Liver → Cholesterol, Bile synthesis
		- Neurons → Myelin synthesis
- Cellular Junctions
	- Gap Junction: Communicating Junction
		- Chemical, Electrical signal between adjoining cells
		- Connexins (channel)
	- Tight Junction: Occluding Junction
		- Restrict materials movement between cells; Barrier
		- Claudin proteins, Occludin proteins
		- intestinal, Kidney epithelial, Blood-brain barrier
	- Anchoring Junction
		- Hold cells
		- Adhering Junction: Cadherin proteins, Actin filaments
		- Desmosome: Cadherin proteins, Plaque glycoprotein, Intermediate Filament
- Extracellular matrix: Glycoprotein, Collagen
- Protein trafficking
	- Signal sequences (in protein)
		- Routing to destination (assisted by motor proteins)
		- (N-terminal signal) binds w/ Signal recognition particle (SRP)
			- SRP receptor on ER → channel protein into ER lumen
		- Nuclear Localization Signal binds w/ Importin → into nucleus
		- N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence
			- Binds w/ Chaperone → maintain unfolded
			- Transported via Translocase of Outer / Inner Mitochondrial membrane (TOM / TIM)
			- Separate signal; May pass TOM but not TIM → Intermembrane space
