# DNA technology & Application

- Cloning
	- Cut w/ Restriction enzyme
		- Cut original portion
		- Cut gap in target DNA vector
			- Usually bacterial plasmid
		- Product
			- Blunt Ends
			- Sticking Ends → Original portion should be compatible
				- 5'-protuding Ends
				- 3'-protuding Ends
	- Paste w/ Ligase
	- Transfer
		- Insert DNA Vector to target "cell"
			- Transformation: Plasmid intake
			- Transduction: Via bacteriophage
			- Conjugation: Via sex pilus
			- Transfection: induced plasmid intake
	- Select & Screen
		- Confirm successful gene transfer
		- Usually via inserting antibiotic resistance gene
- DNA Editing
	- CRISPR-Cas System
		- CRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
		- Cas: CRISPR-associated proteins
		- Originally bacterial immune response against viruses
			- Recognize invader's sequence
				- Bacterial gene includes Cas genes and Repeat-Spacer region
					- Repeat-Spacer → Guide crRNA
					- Spacer matches invader's sequence
					- Cas genes → Cas Complex
					- Cas Complex + crRNA → Protospacer
			- Activate destruction system
			- Binds with invader's sequence and eliminate
		- Application in gene therapy
			- Recognize where to perform actions
				- Gene addition
				- Gene disruption
				- Gene correction
	- Lentivirus System
- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
	- DNA template
	- DNA Polymerase
	- DNA Primers
	- Deoxy Nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)
- Application
	- Biologically-Synthesized Insulin from bacteria
