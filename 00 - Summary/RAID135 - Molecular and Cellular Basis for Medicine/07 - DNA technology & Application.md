# DNA technology & Application

## Recombinant DNA

- Cloning
	- Cut w/ Restriction enzyme
		- Cut original portion
		- Cut gap in target DNA vector
			- Usually bacterial plasmid
			- Cut one / Cut Begin & End
		- Product
			- Blunt Ends
			- Sticking Ends → Original portion should be compatible
				- 5'-protuding Ends
				- 3'-protuding Ends
	- Paste w/ Ligase
	- Transfer
		- Insert DNA Vector to target "cell"
			- Transformation: Plasmid intake
			- Transduction: Via bacteriophage
			- Conjugation: Via sex pilus
			- Transfection: induced plasmid intake
	- Select & Screen
		- Confirm successful gene transfer
		- Usually via inserting antibiotic resistance gene
- DNA Editing
	- CRISPR-Cas System
		- CRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
		- Cas: CRISPR-associated proteins
		- Originally bacterial immune response against viruses
			- Recognize invader's sequence
				- Bacterial gene includes Cas genes and Repeat-Spacer region
					- Repeat-Spacer → Guide crRNA
					- Cas genes → Cas Complex
					- Cas Complex + crRNA → Protospacer
			- Activate destruction system
			- Binds with invader's sequence and eliminate
		- Application in gene therapy
			- Recognize where to perform actions
				- Gene addition
				- Gene disruption
				- Gene correction
	- Lentivirus System
- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
	- Materials
		- DNA template (Double-stranded DNA; dsDNA)
		- DNA Polymerase
		- Deoxy Nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)
		- DNA Primers → Specify only part of template
			- No telomere-like loss
	- Temperature Cycle: Double DNA amount
		- Denaturation: dsDNA → ssDNA
			- High temp.
		- Annealing: ssDNA + Primer
			- Low temp.
		- Extension: DNA Pol.
			- Warm temp.
	- Amplification → Ready for measurement
		- Visible in Amplicon: Gel Electrophoresis
	- Alternative
		- Quantitative Real-time PCR
			- Check number of cycle to reach threshold amount ($C_{t}$)
		- Reverse transcriptase PCR
			- mRNA → cDNA → normal PCR
- Gel Electrophoresis
	- Separate by size / net charge
	- Move through gel via electric potential
		- Different rate depends on Permeability & Charge
- Application
	- Biologically-Synthesized Insulin from bacteria

## DNA Sequencing

- Sanger Method
	- dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) → lost 3' $\ce{OH}$ → Cannot further polymerize
	- PCR → Products with different termination point → Gel Electrophoresis
	- ![Radioactive_Fluorescent_Seq.jpg|250](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Radioactive_Fluorescent_Seq.jpg)
	- Can only read one sequence, many sequences cannot be separated'
- Next-generation Sequencing
	- Sequencing by Synthesis
		- Faster but only short sequence
		- Parallel Sequencing
- Real-time Sequencing
	- Single Molecule Sequencing
		- ssDNA + Enzyme → Polymerization
		- NTP with fluorescent → Sequence of fluorescent signal
			- fluorescent is triggered when NTP Polymerized
	- Nanopore Sequencing
		- ssDNA through pore channel
			- Interrupt electric current through channel
			- Measurable current change → DNA Sequence
- Applications
	- Diagnosis
	- Prevention
	- Transmission Tracking
	- Epigenetic
	- Transcriptomic (RNA)
	- Genomic (DNA)
		- Metagenomic
		- Targeted
