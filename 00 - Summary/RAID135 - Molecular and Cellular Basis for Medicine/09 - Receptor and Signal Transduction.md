# Receptor and Signal Transduction

- Cell-to-cell communication
	- Electrical: Membrane potential (Fast, Mostly nervous system)
	- Chemical: Secreted; Ligands, binds w/ receptor proteins
	- Local communication
		- Gap Junction: Electrical, Ions, Small molecules (AA, ATP, cAMP)
		- Contact-dependent: Antigens, immune, growth & development
		- Autocrine / Paracrine: Self / neighbors (diffusion), Inflammation cytokine
	- Long-distance communication
		- Endocrine glands via Blood
			- Target w/ Receptors for specific hormone response
		- Neurotransmitter: Chemical via Diffusion
		- Neurohormones: Chemical via Blood
- Signaling Pathway
	- Chemical + Receptor → Response (chained)
	- Cellular Response: Modify proteins / Synthesize protein
	- Signal Transduction
		- Ligand-receptor binding (activation) → Second messenger
		- Second messenger + Target protein → Cellular Response
	- Signal Cascade: Signal + Inactive → Active (will act as Signal)
		- Slow
		- Checkpoints (multiple inhibition / activation pathway)
	- Signal Amplification: 1 Signal → Multiple Messenger
		- Ligand-Receptor binding → Amplifier Enzyme Activation
- Target Receptor
	- Intracellular Receptor (second messenger / lipophilic signal)
		- Cytoplasmic / Nuclear Receptor
		- Slow cellular response; Genetic activity
			- Activator protein (coactivator)
	- Extracellular Receptor: Membrane receptor
		- Rapid cellular response
		- Receptor-channel (Ligand-gated channel)
		- G protein-coupled receptor
		- Catalytic Receptor
			- Receptor-Enzyme (Ligand-activated enzyme)
			- Integrin Receptor (Alters enzymes / cytoskeleton)
	- Different receptor → Different Response
		- Epinephrine: $\alpha$-Receptor → Vasoconstriction (intestinal); $\beta_2$-Receptor → Vasodilation (skeletal muscle)
- Ligand-gated ion channels
	- Most Rapid
	- Alters ion permeability → membrane potential → voltage-sensitive proteins
	- e.g. synapse / neuromuscular junction
- G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
	- Seven-transmembrane-spanning proteins (7TM)
		- Have 7 Membrane-spanning region through membrane
		- 3 intracellular loops, 3 extracellular loops → Form active site
		- Extracellular domains binds w/ binding site (Pocket-like)
		- N-terminus at extracellular
		- C-terminus at intracellular; Cytoplasmic tail linked to trimeric G proteins
	- Ligand → GPCRs activates → G protein activates → Secondary messenger
	- G<sub>αs</sub>: Activate adenylyl cyclase → more cAMP: secondary messenger
		- Phosphodiesterase: cAMP → 5'-AMP (natural degradation)
		- Protein kinase A → Protein Phosphorylation (Activation) → Response
	- G<sub>αi</sub>: Inhibit adenylyl cyclase → less cAMP
	- G<sub>αq</sub>: Phospholipase C Amplifier
		- Phospholipase C: phospholipid → Diacylglycerol (membrane) + IP3 (cytoplasm)
		- IP3 → Release $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ from ER → Response
		- Diacylglycerol activate Protein Kinase C → Protein phosphorylation → Response
	- Arrestin: turn off G protein response
		- GPCR activate GPCR Kinase via G protein → GPCR phosphorylation
		- Arrestin + Phosphorylated GPCR → decoupling w/ G protein
			- Desensitization → Stop signal relaying
			- Internalization: Endocytosis → Recycle Endosome / Lysosomal Degradation
- Catalytic Receptor
	- Extracellular Receptor + Cytoplasmic Enzyme
		- Guanylyl Cyclase: GTP → cGMP → cGMP-dependent kinase activation
			- Atrial Natriuretic Peptide, Brain Natriuretic Peptide, C-type Natriuretic Peptide
		- Serine / Threonine Kinase: Cross phosphorylation; SMAD protein
			- Transforming Growth Factor $\beta$
		- Tyrosine kinase: Phosphorylation of tyrosine residue; Autophosphorylation; SH2 domain containing protein
			- Growth factor: Epidermal / Platelet-derived / Vascular endothelial / Insulin & Insulin-like type 1 / Fibroblast
		- Tyrosine kinase-associated: Cytosolic Tyrosine kinase (Src, Janus Kinases)
			- cytokines, growth factors
			- Janus Kinase → Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription family
	- Ligand-induced receptor dimerization → Cross Autophosphorylation → Adaptor protein recruitment → Signaling Complex
