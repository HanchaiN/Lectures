# Elimination of Xenobiotics

- Pharmacokinetics: body's action on drugs
	- Absorption @ GI, Nasal, Lung, Muscle, …
	- Distribution
	- Metabolism (Biotransformation) @ Liver, …
		- Result in metabolite may or may not be active
	- Excretion @ Kidney, Liver, …
		- Renal Excretion (Urine), Hepatic Excretion (Bile)
	- Elimination (Metabolism + Excretion)
- Most xenobiotics are lipophilic; w/o metabolism → accumulate & toxicity
	- Metabolism into hydrophilic derivative → Excrete via urine / bile
