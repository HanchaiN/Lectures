# Thermodynamics

- Work ($\delta W=F\cdot \delta s=PdV$)
    - Pressure $P=\frac{F}{A}$ is an average (perpendicular) force per unit area, hence the component vectors are aligned
- Energy = Ability to do work
    - Kinetic Energy: $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ (classical)
        - For rotating rigid body: $\delta W=\tau \delta\theta\implies K_{R}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}$
        - May emerge as Thermal Energy
    - Potential Energy
        - from Conservative Forces (Path independent work)
            - Gravitational Potential Energy: $F=mg\implies U=mgh$
            - Electric Potential Energy: $F=k\frac{qQ}{r^2}\implies U=k\frac{qQ}{r}$
                - May emerge as Chemical Energy
    - Relativistic Energy
        - Rest Mass Energy: $E=mc^{2}$
- Temperature $T$: measure of internal kinetic energy
    - Internal vibrations of atoms, excluding the overall motion of the system
    - Material Expansion: $\Delta L = L_{0}\alpha\Delta T$
- Heat $Q$: transferred energy due to difference of temperature
    - as vibration of atoms
- [[Enthalpy]] $H$
- Ideal gas
    - No interaction (except elastic collision)
    - Occupy no volume
    - Ideal gas law: $PV=nRT=k_{B}NT$
    - Internal Energy: $U=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}NT$ ($C_{V}=\frac{3}{2}$ for monoatomic gas; replace to $\frac{5}{2}$ for non-stretching diatomic gas)
        - Equipartition theorem assumes each (quadratic) degree of freedom have equal energy: $\frac{1}{2}k_{b}T$

    - [[Isochoric Process]]
    - [[Isobaric Process]]
    - [[Isothermal Process]]
    - [[Adiabatic Process]]
- Heat engine
    - Heat transferred between reservoirs (const. temp.) and work done by engine
    - $e=\frac{W}{Q_H}$
    - Heat pump: Reversed heat transferred and work done to pump
        - $e=\frac{Q}{W}$ ($Q_{C}$ for cooling and $Q_{H}$ for heating)
    - Carnot Engine: [[Reversible Process|Reversible]] engine with two reservoirs
        - [[Isothermal Process|Isothermal]] heat transfer (reversible)
        - [[Adiabatic Process|Adiabatic]] temperature changes (no lost)
        - $e=1-\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$
- [[Entropy]] $S$
    - $dS = \frac{\delta Q_\text{reversible}}{T}$
