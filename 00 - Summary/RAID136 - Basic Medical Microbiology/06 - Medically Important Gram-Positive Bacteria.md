# Medically Important Gram-Positive Bacteria

- *Staphylococcus*: Gram-Positive Cocci in Cluster
	- Staphyle: bunch of grapes
	- Usually w/ Catalase; Neutralize peroxidase
		- Resistance to neutrophils' (digestive enzyme); virulence factor
	- *S. aureus*: High virulence factor (5 stars)
		- Aurum: Golden; golden colony when cultured
		- w/ Coagulase: Induce coagulation; React with serum
			- Use clot as shield from immune response; virulence factor
		- Abscess: usually on epidermis (Abscess containing pus; can be strained for identification)
			- Impetigo: Clustered clots
			- Wound Infection w/ Cellulitis: inflammation @ fat layer
				- Cellulite: Fat layer under epidermis
				- -itis: Inflammation
			- Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome: Infants; whole body
			- Pneumonia w/ Lung Abscess
			- Toxic Shock Syndrome
			- Food Poisoning
	- *S. epidermidis*: Low virulence factor (3 stars)
		- Normal Flora on Epidermis; suppressing fungi growth
			- Tightly attach to epidermis (as well as inorganic surfaces)
			- May forms biofilm
			- Normally controlled by immunity (except weaken / large amount)
		- w/o Coagulase
		- Intravascular catheter colonization/infection
			- Intravascular catheter / Intravenous catheter: needle for vascular system / vein
			- Risk factor: improper sanitization / weaken host
	- *S. saprophyticus*: Uncommon in Thailand (3 stars)
		- Urinary Tract Infection (UTI; stain urine for identification)
			- Cystitis in Female
		- w/o Coagulase
- *Streptococcus*: Gram-Positive Cocci in Chain
	- Streptos: twisted; twisted chain
	- Usually w/o Catalase
	- Hemolysis (via extracellular enzyme)
		- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Beta-hemolysis</mark>: Complete hemolysis
			- Clear area around colony on gel w/ Erythrocytes
			- *S. pyogenes*: Beta-hemolytic *Strep.* group A (5 stars)
				- Group A (classified by rxn w/ antibody)
				- Flesh-eating bacteria
					- Bacterial pharyngitis: Inflammation @ Throat ← Amoxicillin
						- Pharyngitis is usually viral; can self-heal
						- If bacterial, cause severe symptoms if not cured
					- Impetigo: Clustered clots
					- Necrotizing Fasciitis: Inflammation @ Fascia w/ dead tissue
						- Fascia: membrane around muscles
					- Erysipelas: Infection in dermis
						- w/ Scarlet Fever
				- Have similar antigens as human cells → Sequelae (Post-infection)
					- Post Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN)
					- Rheumatic Fever, Rheumatic Heart Disease
			- *S. agalactiae*: Beta-hemolytic *Strep.* group B (4 stars)
				- Group B (classified by rxn w/ antibody)
				- Neonatal Sepsis &/or Meningitis
					- Colonization in vagina when infant is delivered (Neonatal)
					- Infection upon first breath; enters blood (Sepsis)
						- Sepsis: Septicemia + Body-wide immune response
					- Inflammation @ Meninges (membrane around brain & spinal cord; Meningitis; strain cerebrospinal fluid for identify)
				- Puerperal infection
					- Infection upon delivering; enters via vaginal wound
				- Acute Meningitis / Septicemia in Adults
					- Septi-: infection; -emia: blood; Septicemis: Infection in blood
					- Evolved lately (since ~2015)
		- <mark class="hltr-green">Alpha-hemolysis</mark>: Partial hemolysis (except heme)
			- Green area around colony on gel w/ Erythrocytes
			- *S. pneumoniae* (Pneumococci): Gram-positive diplococci in lancet shape (w/ capsule) (5 stars)
				- Diplococci ← broken chain
				- Pneumonia
				- Meningitis
				- Otitis media: Inflammation @ Middle Ear
				- w/ polysaccharide capsule; slippery surface
					- Hard to phagocytosis: virulence factor
			- Viridans *Strep.* (3 stars)
				- > 30 species
				- Low virulence factor
				- Pharyngeal flora → Transient bacteremia
					- Enters blood during microtrauma from teeth-brushing
					- Exists temporary; eliminated by immune response
				- Subacute endocarditis
					- Endocarditis: Inflammation @ inner cardiac membrane
					- Subacute: 1-2 weeks after infection
					- *S. mitis*, *S. sanguinis*, *S. anginosus*
				- Dental Caries: Tooth decay
					- *S. mutans*
			- *S. suis*: Common in Thailand (3 stars)
				- Suis: pig; Generally infection in pig especially in rainy season
				- Can transmit to human upon ingesting undercooked pork; Enter blood
				- Septicemia, Meningitis
					- Can gone deaf & death
				- High virulence factor; High fatality rate
		- <mark class="hltr-red">Gamma-hemolysis</mark>: Non-hemolysis
			- Red area around colony on gel w/ Erythrocytes (Not affected)
			- *Enterococcus* species (3 stars)
				- Normal flora in intestine
				- Low virulence factor
				- UTI, endocarditis, bacteremia, diverticulitis, meningitis
					- Bacteremia: bacteria in blood
					- Diverticulum: Bulging pouches in digestive tract (usually large intestine)
