# Bacterial Genetics

- Haploid, closed, circular
- Extra-chromosome
	- Plasmid
		- Circular double-stranded DNA
		- Replicate independently
		- usually w/ Antibiotic Resistance / Virulence
		- Can share with other bacteria (conjugation)
	- Bacteriophages (via transduction)
		- DNA / RNA
		- Bacterial virus; Specific to bacteria species
		- May cause lytic (replicate inside bacteria) / lysogenic (gene stays in chromosome)
			- Lysogenic can become lytic under stress (activation of viral gene)
- Replication
	- No telomere-equivalent (closed, circular)
	- Each chromosome will temporary bind to cell membrane during cytokinesis
- Gene Expression & Regulation
	- Polycistronic: single promotor, multiple genes, multiple RNAs / proteins –> 1 operon
	- Activation / Repression
	- Regulons: One regulator, multiple operons (pos / neg)
	- Lac Operon
		- Lactose → Allolactose → Release LacI repressor from LacI section on operator → Activated
		- Glucose → less cAMP → Release CAP activator from P/O section on operator → Deactivated
		- w/ Lactose, w/o Glucose; Activated
		- w/ Lactose, w/ Glucose; Deactivated
		- w/o Lactose; Deactivated
- Translation
	- 30S + 50S = 70S
	- Inhibition: Treatment Candidate
- Horizontal gene transfer
	- Transfer to same generation (opposed to vertical from parent to daughters)
	- Mediated by mobile genetic elements
		- Conjugation
			- Plasmid / genomic DNA moved through sex-pilus to recipient
		- Transduction
			- Phage contains donor DNA fragment
			- Phage infects recipient; inject donor DNA
		- Transformation
			- Cell Lysis release DNA fragments
			- Donor DNA enters recipient
- Application
	- Track evolutions and transmission route of infection
	- Identification of bacterial species
	- Identification of antibiotic resistance
