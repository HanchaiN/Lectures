# Nomenclature and Classification of Medically Important Bacteria

- Classification by Shape
	- Coccus (plu. Cocci)
	- Bacillus (plu. Bacilli)
- Classification by Gram Reaction
	- Gram Reaction
		- Crystal violet reacts w/ peptidoglycan (purple)
		- Gram Iodine fixes the strain (n. mordant)
		- Acetone Alcohol washes unfixed crystal violet (& outer plasma membrane of Gram-Negative bacteria)
		- Safranin as counter stain on peptidoglycan (red; weaker color)
	- Gram-Positive (Purple)
		- Thick peptidoglycan → Drought resistance
	- Gram-Negative (Red)
		- Double plasma membrane → High selectivity; Drug resistance
	- Unclassified
		- No cell wall
		- Special cell wall w/ different components
