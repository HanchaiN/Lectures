# Staphylococcus aureus

- aka *Staph. aureus*
- Etymology: Golden cluster of grapes
- Properties
	- Coccal
	- Grow in Clusters
	- Gram positive
	- Golden-yellow color on blood agar
	- Facultative anaerobes
	- Non-motile
	- Non spore-forming
	- Produce Catalase: $\ce{2H2O2 -> 2H2O + O2}$
		- Foamed when react w/ hydrogen peroxide
	- Coagulase positive: Fibrinogen → Fibrin
		- Not in *Staph. epidermidis*, *Staph. saprophyticus*
		- Form clumped sticky fibrin when react w/ plasma w/ fibrinogen
	- Biofilm in medical implants
		- Intravenous catheter
		- Extracellular matrix w/ gel-like exopolysaccharide (EPS)
			- Biochemical signals
			- Exchange genes (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes)
		- Thrive of but slowly divide
		- Hard to remove by antibiotics (cannot penetrate ECM)
			- Often removal of growing surface
- Extremely common
	- 1/4 of population is colonized in nostrils, armpits, groin, epidermis
	- Skin flora
	- pH, Humidity, Sweat level, other bacteria (factors) → Dysbiosis
		- Penetrate microfissures, trauma → Infection
- Skin infection
	- Localized skin infection: Pimple → Furuncle / Boil → Carbuncle
	- Diffused skin infection
		- Superficial impetigo
	- @Epidermis
	- @Cellulitis (Dermis); Can spread rapidly
	- Subcutaneous abscess
		- Pus, Septations
		- @Mouth → Dental abscess
		- @Liver, Kidney, Spleen, Brain
		- @Muscle → Pyomyositis
		- @Bone → Osteomyelitis
		- @Joints → Septic arthritis
- Bacteremia → Septic thrombophlebitis (infected blood clot)
	- Transmitted via Surgery, Dental work, From skin trauma
		- High Risk: Immunocompromised / Risk for infective endocarditis
			- Given Antibiotic prophylaxis
	- Widespread immune reaction → Vasodilation → Hypotension & Poor perfusion (Sepsis)
	- @CNS → Bacterial meningitis, Epidural abscess
	- @Lung → Severe pneumonia
	- @Heart Valves → Infective endocarditis (Vegetation)
- Superantigens (Toxins)
	- Toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1)
		- Produce at site of infection, entering blood stream
		- Bind w/ Major histocompatibility complex Type 2 (MHC-II)
			- Activate Antigen presenting cell → Cytokines (Pro-inflammatory)
		- Toxic Shock Syndrome
			- Fever, Rash, Low blood pressure, poor end-organ perfusion → death
	- Panton-Valentine Leukocidin Toxin (PVL)
		- Pore-forming toxin: Kill leukocyte by necrosis → Inflammation
		- Necrotizing pneumonia → Tissue death → Organ failure
	- Hemolysin
		- Pore-forming toxin: Kill erythrocyte, releasing Hemoglobin
			- $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ is absorbed
	- Exfoliatin Toxin
		- Straphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS, Ritter's disease)
		- Painful patches of red skin & fluid-filled blisters
		- Resolved within weeks
	- Enterotoxin
		- Stable
			- Accumulate in foods
			- Active after bacteria is killed by cooking
		- Food poisoning
			- Vomiting & Diarrhea within hours
		- Toxic shock syndrome if enter blood stream
- Treatment
	- Antibiotics
		- Rapid antibiotic resistance development
		- Penicillin (beta-lactam antibiotic)
			- Disrupt DD-transpeptidase (Penicillin-binding protein, PBP)
				- Cross-linking amino polysaccharide in peptidoglycan cell wall
					- N-Acetylglucosamine (NAG), N-Acetylmuramic Acid (NAM)
					- Tetrapeptide, Pentapeptide chain (connected by transpeptidation)
				- Leaky cell wall, Cannot divide
			- Beta-lactamase → Break beta-lactam ring ← Resistance
		- Clavulanic acid (Beta-lactamase inhibitor)
			- Binds and disable beta-lactamases
		- Methicillin (Beta-lactam antibiotic)
			- Not easily broken by beta-lactamase
			- Methicillin resistant *Staph. aureus* (MRSA)
				- mecA gene → Special PBP ← Resistance
				- Health-care associated (HA-MRSA): Hospitals, Nursing homes
					- High usage of antibiotics
				- Community-associated (CA-MRSA)
					- Rampant antibiotic use on factory farms
					- Overprescription
		- Vancomycin (Glycopeptide antibiotic)
			- Not as effective, Problematic side effects
			- Vancomycin Intermediate *Straph. aureus* (VISA): Intermediate resistance
			- Vancomycin Resistance *Straph. aureus* (VRSA)
	- Antibiogram: Test against antibiotics → Choose appropriate
		- MRSA → Clindamycin, Vancomycin
		- Alt.: Tetracyclines, Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, Linezolid, Tigecycline, Daptomycin, Quinupristin-Dalfopristin
