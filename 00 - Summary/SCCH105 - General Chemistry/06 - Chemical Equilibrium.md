# Chemical Equilibrium

- Forward reaction and backward reaction  
         - (Dynamic) Equilibrium: $r_{\text{forward}}=r_{\text{reverse}}$ ($Q=K$)  
         - Reaction is often elementary.
- Equilibrium constant: $K=\frac{k_{\text{forward}}}{k_{\text{reverse}}}$
- Reaction Quotient: $Q=\frac{\left[\text{product}\right]}{\left[\text{reactant}\right]}$ (including the effect of the reaction order)  
         - Will move towards equilibrium constant.
- Solve with Initial-Change-Equilibrium table
- Le Chatelier's principle: Equilibrium will resist changes (partially)  
         - Equilibrium Constant may change.
- Catalyst doesn't affect equilibrium constant, it only make it reach equilibrium faster.
