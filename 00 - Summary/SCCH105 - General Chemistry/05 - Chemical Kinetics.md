# Chemical Kinetics

- Reaction Rate: $r_{A}=\frac{d\left[A\right]}{dt}$
	- Reaction Order: $r\propto \left[A\right]^{n}$
		- Zeroth order: $\left[A\right]\propto -t$
		- First order: $\left[A\right]\propto e^{-t}$
		- Second order: $\left[A\right]\propto \frac{1}{t}$
	- Added reaction: Multiplied Rate
	- Solid reactant is not included.
	- Gaseous reactant may rely on pressure.
	- May not include all reactants in heterogeneous reactions. (included with zeroth order)
- Collision Theory
	- Particle must collide to react
		- Increase conc / Increase Temp → Increase rate
	- The collision must have enough energy ($E\ge E_{a}$)
	- The collision must be correct orientation
	- Reaction order is equal to the stoichiometric coefficient for elementary reactions (reaction with single step)
- Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution: Energy distribution at temperature
	- High temperature → Shifted toward higher energy
	- Can be renormalize by number of molecules (equiv. concentration)
- Transition state theory
	- Maximum energy (equiv. $E_{a}$)
	- Partial bonds formed and will be broken, changing the molecules
- Arrhenius equation: $k=Ae^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}\iff\ln k=\ln A - \frac{E_{a}}{R}\frac{1}{T}$
- Rate-determining step: slowest step (highest $E_{a}$), apply for non-elementary reaction
- Catalyst: lower $E_{a}$, doesn't affect $\Delta H$
	- Homogeneous catalyst: same phase as mixture
	- Lock-and-key model: fixed active site matches the substrates
	- Induced-fit model: active site change shape to bind more effectively
