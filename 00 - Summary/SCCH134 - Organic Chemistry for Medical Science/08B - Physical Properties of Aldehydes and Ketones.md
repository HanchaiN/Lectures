# Physical Properties of Aldehydes and Ketones

- Electronegativity â†’ Partial positive charge on adjacent carbon
  - Dipole-dipole interaction
- Can form H-bond w/ $\ce{H2O}$
  - Aldehyde $\ce{H}$ cannot form H-bond (EN of $\ce{C}$ is not high enough)
    - Lower BP & Solubility compare to Alcohol

## Reference

- Handout SCCH134
