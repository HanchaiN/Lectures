# Reactions of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

- Acidity Reaction: $\ce{RCOOH + H2O <=>[K_{a}] RCOO^{-} + H3O+}$
	- Can ionize spontaneously
	- Inductive Effect vs Resonance Effect
		- Inductive: through bonds (EN)
			- Effect depends on distance
		- Resonance: delocalizing
			- Have stronger effect
			- Possibly via Conjugation system
			- ortho- / parahave more effect than metadespite the distance
		- EDG → Less Acidic & EWG → More Acidic
	- More acidic than phenol and alcohol (and water), resp.
		- Less resonance than phenol but negative charge goes to high EN
		- $\ce{NaH}$: $\ce{R-COOH}$, $\ce{Ar-OH}$, $\ce{R-OH}$
		- $\ce{NaOH}$: $\ce{R-COOH}$, $\ce{Ar-OH}$
		- $\ce{NaHCO3}$: $\ce{R-COOH}$
