# Intermolecular Forces

- [[Ionic Bonding]] (Electrostatic Attraction)
- Dipole-dipole Attraction
  - Charge attraction
- Van der Waals Attraction (Non-polar Interaction but may be possible in polar molecule)
  - London Dispersion Forces
  - Hydrophobic Interaction
  - Depends on molecular surface area (heuristically, molecular weight)
  - Temporary uneven charge distribution
- Hydrogen bonding
  - (Partially)-Positively charged Hydrogen & Atoms w/ high electronegativity & lone electron pair
  - Significantly weaker than [[Covalent Bonding]] but stronger than dipole-dipole interaction
  - Amides > Carboxylic Acids > Alcohols > Amines

## Effects on mechanism of Biomolecules

- Drug targets at the molecular level
  - Drug ($<\pu{1000 amu}$)
  - Target: Macromolecules ($>\pu{1000 amu}$)
    - Enzyme, Receptor, Transport protein, Nucleic Acid
  - Binding site
    - Attraction and Repulsion causing (specific) binding
    - See pharmacodynamics for more
