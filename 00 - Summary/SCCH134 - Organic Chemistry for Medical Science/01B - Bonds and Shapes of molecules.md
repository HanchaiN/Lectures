# Bonds and Shapes of molecules

- Bond
    - [[Ionic Bonding]]
        - Transferred Electron → Ions (Electric Charges) → Attraction
        - Uncommon in Organic Chemistry (Carbon is unlikely to be an isolated ions, but compound ions are possible)
            - Carbocation, Carbanion (w/ [[Formal Charge]])
    - [[Covalent Bonding]]
        - Octet Rule
        - $\sigma$-bond & $\pi$-bond (by shape)
        - Single bond & Double bond & Triple bond (by number of shared electrons)
            - Generally one $\sigma$-bond and the rest is $\pi$-bond
        - Polarity of covalent bond
            - [[Electronegativity]] (Pauling Scale of Electronegativity)
                - $\chi_{\ce{F}}>\chi_{\ce{O}}>\chi_{\ce{N}}\approx\chi_{\ce{Cl}}>\chi_{\ce{Br}}>\chi_{\ce{S}}\approx\chi_{\ce{C}}$
            - [[Bond Dipole Moment]]
                - Molecular dipole moment: Directional Sum of Bond Dipole Moment
- Molecular Shapes
- [[Formal Charge]]
    - Cut bonds in half
    - Play role in Reaction Mechanism
        - May indicate with charge in circle $\oplus$, $\ominus$
