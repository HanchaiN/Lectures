# Bonds and Shapes of molecules

- Bond
	- [[Ionic Bonding]]
		- Transferred Electron → Ions (Electric Charges) → Attraction
	- [[Covalent Bonding]]
		- Octet Rule
		- $\sigma$-bond & $\pi$-bond (by shape)
		- Single bond & Double bond & Triple bond (by number of shared electrons)
			- Generally one $\sigma$-bond and the rest is $\pi$-bond
		- Polarity of covalent bond
			- [[Electronegativity]] (Pauling Scale of Electronegativity)
				- $\chi_{\ce{F}}>\chi_{\ce{O}}>\chi_{\ce{N}}\approx\chi_{\ce{Cl}}>\chi_{\ce{Br}}>\chi_{\ce{S}}\approx\chi_{\ce{C}}$
			- [[Bond Dipole Moment]]
- Molecular Shapes
- Formal Charges (Cut bonds in half)
