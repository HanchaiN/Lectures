- Acyclic molecules
    - Dihedral angle ($\phi$): angle that rotated from one carbon to another (shown in Newman projection)
    - Stability (Steric Effect)

    - Terminology of each conformer
        - Eclipsed: Perfect overlap $\phi=\pu{0 \degree}$
            - Syn-periplanar: least stable: large functional group overlapped
            - Anticlinal eclipsed: Hydrogen overlap with large functional group
        - Staggered: Perfect anti-overlap $\phi=\pu{60 \degree}$
            - Anti: most stable: large functional group on the opposite side
            - Gauche: large functional group with $\phi=\pu{60 \degree}$
        - Skew: in between
- Cyclic molecules
    - Cyclopropane: planar
    - Cyclobutane: bond angle $\pu{88 \degree}$, non planar
    - Cyclopentane: bond angle $\pu{102-106 \degree}$, 4 carbons on a plane
    - Cyclohexane: bond angle $\pu{109.5 \degree}$, chair/boat conformer

        - Chair (A): (Gauche) Staggered
            - Axial hydrogen (perp. to ring) vs Equatorial hydrogen (side-wise)
                - Note: by going back and forth between chair and boat, axial hydrogen can become equatorial hydrogen (up remains up; down remains down)

                - More steric repulsion between axial positions (1,3-diaxial interaction) â†’ Equatorial position are more favorable for large functional group
                - When select equatorial-axial or axial-equatorial, compare strength of 1,3-diaxial interaction between each functional group and hydrogen
        - Twist-boat (B)
        - Boat (C): (Syn-Periplanar) Eclipsed
            - Unstability from flagpole interaction
        - Half-chair (D)
- Configurations of Monosaccharide
    - *L*- / *D*-configuration; depends on the position of the last alcohol group when drawn in fisher projection w/ Aldehyde/Ketone at the top. Right: *D*; Left: *L*
