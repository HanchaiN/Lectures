# Terminology

- Plane of Symmetry: Plane that bisect an object into half each of which is a mirror-image of one another.
- Chirality: Asymmetry (object is consider chiral if there is no plane of symmetry, otherwise it is achiral)
- Stereogenic Center: Part of a molecule that if atoms or groups that relate with the part moves will results in a stereoisomer
    - Chiral Carbon ($\ce{C^\ast}$): Carbon with sp3 hybrid orbital with 4 different functional groups
    - Chiral axis: the axis across which the molecule is not symmetric (plane that perpendicular to the axis is not symmetric with a plane of symmetry)
        - e.g. Allele, biphenyl (sometime cannot rotate from one to another â†’ not conformer), spiro compounds

- Chiral molecule and Achiral molecule
    - Chiral molecule will have stereogenic center (the reverse is not necessary true)
