# Terminology

- Plane of Symmetry: Plane that bisect an object into half each of which is a mirror-image of one another.
- Chirality: Asymmetry (object is consider chiral if there is no plane of symmetry, otherwise it is achiral)
- Stereogenic Center: Part of a molecule that if atoms or groups that relate with the part moves will results in a stereoisomer
	- Chiral Carbon: Carbon with sp3 hybrid orbital with 4 different functional groups
	- Chiral axis: the axis through which

	  ```smiles
		C(/[R])(\[R])=C=C([R])[R]
		```

- Chiral molecule and Achiral molecule
	- Chiral molecule will have stereogenic center (the reverse is not necessary true)
