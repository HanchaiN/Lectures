# Physical Properties

- Solubility
	- Depends on [[01C - Intermolecular Forces|Intermolecular Forces]]
	- like dissolves like
		- Hydrophilic
			- Ionic, Polar, H-bond
			- Alcohol with $<5\ce{C}$
		- Hydrophobic
- Boiling Points
	- Depends on [[01C - Intermolecular Forces|Intermolecular Forces]]
- Melting Points
	- Depends on [[01C - Intermolecular Forces|Intermolecular Forces]]
	- Depends on Packing

## Effects on mechanism of Biomolecules

- Cellular Functions
	- Selective Membrane and Transport Protein
- Saturated fat (in triglyceride) will have higher melting point due to the orderly packing

## Reference

- Handout SCCH134
