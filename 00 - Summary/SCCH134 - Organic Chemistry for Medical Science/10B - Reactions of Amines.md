# Reactions of Amines

- Basicity Reaction (Protonation): $\ce{R3-NH+ + H2O <=>[K_{a}] R3-N + H3O+}$
	- Consider $K_{a}$ of conjugated acid, strong acid = weak base
	- Inductive Effect vs Resonance Effect
		- Inductive: through bonds (EN)
			- Effect depends on distance
		- Resonance: delocalizing
			- Have stronger effect
			- Possibly via Conjugation system
			- If lone pair is delocalized, prefer not to be bonded → Less Basic
				- If lone pair is aromatic → Very weak base
		- EDG → More Basic & EWG → Less Basic
	- Hybridization with $\ce{s}$-characteristic → Less Basic
