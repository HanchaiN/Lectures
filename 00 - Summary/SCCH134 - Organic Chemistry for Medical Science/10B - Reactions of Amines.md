# Reactions of Amines

- Basicity Reaction (Protonation): $\ce{R3-NH+ + H2O <=>[K_{a}] R3-N + H3O+}$
	- Consider $K_{a}$ of conjugated acid, strong acid = weak base
	- Inductive Effect vs Resonance Effect
		- Inductive: through bonds (EN)
			- Effect depends on distance
		- Resonance: delocalizing
			- Have stronger effect
			- Possibly via Conjugation system
			- If lone pair is delocalized, prefer not to be bonded → Less Basic
				- If lone pair is aromatic → Very weak base
		- EDG → More Basic & EWG → Less Basic
	- Hybridization with $\ce{s}$-characteristic → Less Basic
- Reactions with Electrophiles
	- Alkylation: $\ce{N-H + R-X -> N-R}$
		- Reagent
			- Amines (excess)
				- Excess → Avoid Multiple Alkylation (but some will not be alkylated)
				- Ammonia → Primary → Secondary → Tertiary
			- (Primary Alkyl) Halides
		- Mechanism
			- Substitution ($\ce{S_{N}}2$): $\ce{R-X ->[N-H] R-N^{+}-H + X-}$
			- Deprotonation: $\ce{R-N^{+}-H ->[N] R-N}$
	- Acylation: $\ce{N-H + R-CO-Z -> R-CO-N}$
		- Reagent
			- Acid Halides / Carboxylic Acid
		- Peptide formation
		- Mechanism: Nucleophilic substitution of Carboxylic Acid & Derivatives
	- Sulfonation: $\ce{N-H + Ar-SO2-Cl -> Ar-SO2-N}$
		- Mechanism
			- Similar to Acylation (Replace $\ce{-C(=O)-}$ with $\ce{-S(=O)2-}$)
			- Similar to Sulfonate Ester Formation of Alcohol
		- Hinsberg Test
			- $\ce{Ph-SO2-Cl + R2-NH ->[NaOH (aq, excess)] Ph-SO2-N-R2}$ (solid → cloudy)
			- $\ce{Ph-SO2-NH-R ->[NaOH (aq, excess)] Ph-SO2-N^{-}-R}$ (fast, water-soluble)
				- Only Primary Amine result in protonatable product
				- Replace Sulfonyl with Carbonyl will not result in protonation
			- $\ce{Ph-SO2-N^{-}-R ->[H+] Ph-SO2-NH-R}$ (solid → cloudy)
	- Reductive Amination: $\ce{R-CO-R + NH -> R-C(=N)-R ->[\hat{h}] R-CH(N)R}$
		- Reduced with $\ce{H2,Ni}$ or $\ce{NaBH4}$ or $\ce{NaBH3CN}$
		- Intermediate $\ce{R-C(=N)-R}$
			- Imine ($\ce{R-C(=NR)-R}$) for ammonia and primary amines
			- Iminium Ion ($\ce{R-C(=N^{+}R2)-R}$) for secondary amines
- Reactions with Nitrous Acid
