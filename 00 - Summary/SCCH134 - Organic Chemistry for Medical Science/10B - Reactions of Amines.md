# Reactions of Amines

- Basicity Reaction (Protonation): $\ce{R3-NH+ + H2O <=>[K_{a}] R3-N + H3O+}$
	- Consider $K_{a}$ of conjugated acid, strong acid = weak base
	- Inductive Effect vs Resonance Effect
		- Inductive: through bonds (EN)
			- Effect depends on distance
		- Resonance: delocalizing
			- Have stronger effect
			- Possibly via Conjugation system
			- If lone pair is delocalized, prefer not to be bonded → Less Basic
				- If lone pair is aromatic → Very weak base
		- EDG → More Basic & EWG → Less Basic
	- Hybridization with $\ce{s}$-characteristic → Less Basic
- Alkylation: $\ce{N-H + R-X -> N-R}$
	- Reagent
		- Amines (excess)
			- Excess → Avoid Multiple Alkylation (but some will not be alkylated)
			- Ammonia → Primary → Secondary → Tertiary
		- (Primary Alkyl) Halides
	- Mechanism
		- Substitution ($\ce{S_{N}}2$): $\ce{R-X ->[N-H] R-N^{+}-H + X-}$
		- Deprotonation: $\ce{R-N^{+}-H ->[N] R-N}$
- Acylation: $\ce{N-H + R-CO-Z -> R-CO-N}$
	- Reagent
		- Amines
		- Acid Halides / Carboxylic Acid
	- Peptide formation
	- Mechanism: Nucleophilic substitution of Carboxylic Acid & Derivatives
