# Reactions of Amines

- Basicity Reaction (Protonation): $\ce{R3-NH+ + H2O <=>[K_{a}] R3-N + H3O+}$
    - Consider $K_{a}$ of conjugated acid, strong acid = weak base
    - Inductive Effect vs Resonance Effect
        - Inductive: through bonds (EN)
            - Effect depends on distance
        - Resonance: delocalizing
            - Have stronger effect
            - Possibly via Conjugation system
            - If lone pair is delocalized, prefer not to be bonded → Less Basic
                - If lone pair is aromatic → Very weak base
        - EDG → More Basic & EWG → Less Basic
    - Hybridization with $\ce{s}$-characteristic → Less Basic
- Reactions with Electrophiles
    - Alkylation: $\ce{N-H + R-X -> N-R}$
        - Reagent
            - Amines (excess)
                - Excess → Avoid Multiple Alkylation (but some will not be alkylated)
                - Ammonia → Primary → Secondary → Tertiary
            - (Primary Alkyl) Halides
        - Mechanism
            - Substitution ($\ce{S_{N}}2$): $\ce{R-X ->[N-H] R-N^{+}-H + X-}$
            - Deprotonation: $\ce{R-N^{+}-H ->[N] R-N}$
    - Acylation: $\ce{N-H + R-CO-Z -> R-CO-N}$
        - Reagent
            - Acid Halides / Carboxylic Acid
        - Peptide formation
        - Mechanism: Nucleophilic substitution of Carboxylic Acid & Derivatives
    - Sulfonation: $\ce{N-H + Ar-SO2-Cl -> Ar-SO2-N}$
        - Mechanism
            - Similar to Acylation (Replace $\ce{-C(=O)-}$ with $\ce{-S(=O)2-}$)
            - Similar to Sulfonate Ester Formation of Alcohol
        - Hinsberg Test
            - $\ce{Ph-SO2-Cl + R2-NH ->[NaOH (aq, excess)] Ph-SO2-N-R2}$ (solid → cloudy)
            - $\ce{Ph-SO2-NH-R ->[NaOH (aq, excess)] Ph-SO2-N^{-}-R}$ (fast, water-soluble)
                - Only Primary Amine result in protonatable product
                - Replace Sulfonyl with Carbonyl will not result in protonation
            - $\ce{Ph-SO2-N^{-}-R ->[H+] Ph-SO2-NH-R}$ (solid → cloudy)
    - Reductive Amination: $\ce{R-CO-R + NH -> R-C(=N)-R ->[\hat{h}] R-CH(N)R}$
        - Reduced with $\ce{H2,Ni}$ or $\ce{NaBH4}$ or $\ce{NaBH3CN}$
        - Intermediate $\ce{R-C(=N)-R}$
            - Imine ($\ce{R-C(=NR)-R}$) for ammonia and primary amines
            - Iminium Ion ($\ce{R-C(=N^{+}R2)-R}$) for secondary amines
- Reactions with Nitrous Acid
    - Diazonium Salt Formation: $\ce{R-NH2 ->[NaNO2, HCl][\pu{0\degree C}] R-{N^{+}}#N + Cl^{-}}$
        - Mechanism
            - $\ce{HNO2 ->[H+] O=N-O^{+}H2 -> O=N^{+}}$
            - $\ce{R-NH2 ->[N^{+}=O] R-N^{+}H2-N=O -> R-NH-N=O}$
            - $\ce{R-NH-N=O ->[H+] R-N^{+}H=N-OH -> R-N=N-OH}$
            - $\ce{R-N=N-OH ->[H+] R-N=N-O^{+}H2 -> R-{N^{+}}#N}$
    - Primary Aliphatic Amine: $\ce{R-{N^{+}}#N -> R^{+} + N2}$ (unstable even at low temp)
        - Potential Rearrangement
        - Can form Alcohols, Halides, Alkenes (Second step of $\ce{S_{N}2}$ and $\ce{E2}$)
    - Primary Aromatic Amine: Diazonium Salt can be stable at low temp
        - $\ce{Ar-N2+ ->[CuCl] Ar-Cl}$ & $\ce{Ar-N2+->[CuBr] Ar-Br}$ & $\ce{Ar-N2+ ->[KI] Ar-I}$
        - $\ce{Ar-N2+ ->[CuCN] Ar-CN}$

        - $\ce{Ar-N2+ ->[Ar-EDG] Ar-N=N-Ar-EDG}$ (azo compound)
            - Note: $\ce{-N2+}$ is weak electrophile, require activated aromatic
            - Note: "para-" > "ortho-"
    - Sec-amines: $\ce{R2-NH ->[N+O] R2-N+H-N=O-> R2-N-N=O}$
