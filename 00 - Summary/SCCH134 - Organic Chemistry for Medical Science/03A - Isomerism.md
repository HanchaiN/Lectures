# Isomerism

- Isomer: same molecular formular
    - Structural Isomers / Constitutional Isomers: different functional group and/or skeletal structure
    - Stereoisomer: same topology
        - Conformational Isomers / Conformers: Can transform into one another via Rotations around single bonds
        - Configurational Isomers: Cannot transform into one another w/o breaking bonds
            - Enantiomers: Reflection
            - Diastereomers: Not a reflection
