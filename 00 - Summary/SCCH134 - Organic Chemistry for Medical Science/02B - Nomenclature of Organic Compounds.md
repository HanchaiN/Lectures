# Nomenclature of Organic Compounds

- Aliphatic Hydrocarbons
    - [[##Parent Name]]: Parent chain (Longest chain w/ functional group)
- Indexing: Minimize substituent's index, prioritize by [[##Nomenclature Order of Functional Groups]] then name
- Suffix: define Functional Group
    - Primary suffix: w/ index as hyphenated prefix (if not 1)
        - alkane: -ane
        - alkene: -ene
        - alkyne: -yne
    - Secondary suffix: w/ index as hyphenated prefix (if not 1), the lowest index / highest priority only, after primary suffix (w/o the last 'e', w/ hyphen) (with exceptions)
        - Note: If both alkene and alkyne exists, alkyne will be primary prefix.
        - Note: If both alkene and alkyne exists, sum of their indices will be minimized. If multiple indexing have the same sum, alkene will have lower index.
- Prefix: define substituent (order by name, excluding number & index prefix)
    - Primary prefix: cyclefor cyclic hydrocarbons
    - Secondary prefix: w/ index as hyphenated prefix
- If multiple instances of same functional groups / substituents, add number prefix (2: di- / 3: tri- / 4: tetra- / 5: penta-)
- Aromatic Hydrocarbons
    - Specific names
    - Common name w/ 2 functional groups: 1,2: *ortho*- / 1,3: *meta*- / 1,4: *para*-
- Hydrocarbon substituent
    - alkane → alkyl
    - alkene → alkenyl
    - alkyne → alkynyl
    - [[##Common Names for Hydrocarbon Substituent]]
- Configuration
    - Parenthesized and hyphened before the name of the parent structure e.g. "(*R*)-".
    - Multiple configurations are ordered by index and will be preceded with unspaced index, separated by comma e.g. "(2*Z*,6*S*)-".
    - *E*- / *Z*- (common: *cis*- / *trans*-)
    - *R*- / *S*-
    - Unsaturated fatty acid may use $\omega$ notation to identify the position of the first double bond (counting from the end of the carbon chain) e.g. "$\omega$-3"
