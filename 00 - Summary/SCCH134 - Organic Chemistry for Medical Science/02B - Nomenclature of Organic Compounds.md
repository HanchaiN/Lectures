# Nomenclature of Organic Compounds

- Aliphatic Hydrocarbons
	- Name : Parent chain (Longest chain w/ functional group) [^1]
- Indexing: Minimize substituent's index, prioritize by [[##Nomenclature Order of Functional Groups]] then name
- Suffix: define Functional Group
	- Primary suffix: w/ index as hyphenated prefix (if not 1)
		- alkane: -ane
		- alkene: -ene
		- alkyne: -yne
	- Secondary suffix: w/ index as hyphenated prefix (if not 1), the lowest index / highest priority only, after primary suffix (w/o the last 'e', w/ hyphen) (with exceptions)
		- Note: if both alkene and alkyne exists, alkyne will be primary prefix but if different indexing have same index, alkene will have lower index
- Prefix: define substituent (order by name, excluding number & index prefix)
	- Primary prefix: cycle for cyclic hydrocarbons
	- Secondary prefix: w/ index as hyphenated prefix
- If multiple instances of same functional groups / substituents, add number prefix (2: di- / 3: tri- / 4: tetra- / 5: penta-)
- Aromatic Hydrocarbons
	- Specific names
	- Common name: 1,2: ortho- / 1,3: meta- / 1,4: para-
- Hydrocarbon substituent
	- alkane → alkyl
	- alkene → alkenyl
	- alkyne → alkynyl
