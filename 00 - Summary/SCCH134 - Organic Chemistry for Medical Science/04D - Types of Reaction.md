# Types of Reaction

```smiles
[Y]C([R])-C([R])[Z]
[Y]C([R])-C([Z])[R]
```

- (syn- / anti-) Addition Reaction: $\ce{C=C + Y-Z -> C(Y)-C(Z)}$
	- Electrophilic Addition:  
	  $\ce{C=C + HBr -> C(H)-C + C-C(H) + C(Br)-C + C-C(Br)}$
	- Radical Addition  
	  $\ce{C=C + HBr ->[HO-OH -> HO. + .OH] C(H)-C + C-C(H) + C(Br)-C + C-C(Br)}$
	- Nucleophilic Addition:  
	  $\ce{C=C + HCN}$
- (syn- / anti-) Elimination Reaction: $\ce{C(Y)-C(Z) -> C=C + Y-Z}$
- Substitution Reaction: $\ce{C-L + Z -> C-Z + L}$
	- a
	- a
	- a
	- Aromatic Substitution: $\ce{Ar-L + Z ->[\text{catalyst}] Ar-Z + L}$
- Rearrangement Reaction
	- Carbocation
- Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
	- Oxidation ($\hat{o}$): More $\ce{O}$, More $\ce{X}$ (multiple bond count multiple times)
	- Reduction: More $\ce{H}$, More $\ce{M}$ (multiple bond count multiple times)
