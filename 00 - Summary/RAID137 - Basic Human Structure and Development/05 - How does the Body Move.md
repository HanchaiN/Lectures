# How does the Body Move

- Musculoskeletal System
	- Skeletal System
		- Bones (206 in adults) & Cartilages & Ligaments
			- Joints
		- Bones
			- Functions
				- Support the body, Protect internal organs
				- Facilitate movement
				- Produce blood cell (Red bone marrow)
				- Store & release minerals (e.g. Calcium) & fat (Yellow bone marrow)
				- Endocrine System
					- PTH → Activate Osteoclast; Release Calcium
				- Fracture callus; Require Calcium to heal
					- PTH → More Calcium in blood
					- GI Tract synthesize Vitamin D → More Ca absorption
			- Classification by Shapes
				- Long bone: Leverage
				- Short bone: Stability, Support w/ motion
				- Flat bone: Muscle attachment, Protection
				- Irregular bone: Protection
				- Sesamoid bone: Protect tendons from compressive force (usually embed in tendon)
			- Structure (Long bone)
				- Diaphysis: Center, Tubular shaft, compact bone w/ cavity
					- Medullary Cavity w/ Yellow bone marrow (Adipose tissue)
				- Metaphysis: In between
					- Epiphyseal plate (growth plate): Hyaline cartilage
						- Calcified to Epiphyseal line: no longer grow
				- Proximal / Distal Epiphysis: Wider part at each end
					- Spongy bone w/ Red bone marrow
					- Articular Cartilage at each ends; no blood supply & nerve innervation
			- Membranes
				- Endosteum: lining medullary cavity
					- Simple connective tissue; Delicate membrane
					- Bone Metabolism: Growth, Repair, Remodeling
				- Periosteum: outer surface
					- Blood vessels, Nerves, Lymphatic vessels
						- Extends into compact bone
					- Fibrous layer, Cellular layer
			- Cells
				- Osteogenic cell: stem cell → Osteoblasts
				- Osteoblast (OB): Immature, release osteoid (components of bone matrix)
				- Osteocyte: Mature (differentiate from Osteoblast w/ calcified osteoid)
					- w/ Canaliculi: Net-like Branching, connect with neighbors
					- Maintain bone matrix
				- Osteoclast (OC): Multinucleate, Secrete acids & enzymes dissolving bone matrix
					- Monocytes & Macrophages
			- Bone Homeostasis: Bone resorption (OC) ~ Bone formation (OB)
				- Bone remodeling
				- Osteoporosis: Bone resorption > Bone formation; less dense bone
			- Compact bone
				- Osteon / Harversian System
					- Cylindrical bone structure
					- Concentric lamellae: Rings of bone matrix w/ osteocytes in lacuna between rings
					- Central canal: blood, nerve, lymph
				- Perforating canal / Volkmann's canal: connect between osteons
				- Withstand compressive force
			- Spongy bone / Cancellous bone
				- Trabeculae: Net-like bone structure
					- w/ Concentric lamellae w/o Central canal
				- Distribute weights
			- Bone Formation (Ossification)
				- Intramembranous Ossification
					- Fetus → Adolescence @ Clavicle, Skull, Facial bones
						- Fast Ossification
					- Ossification center: Cluster of Mesenchymal cells (mesoderm)
						- Mesenchymal cells → Osteogenic cells → Osteoblasts
					- Calcification: Hardening w/ Calcium from blood vessel
						- Osteoblasts → Osteocyte
					- Trabeculae & Periosteum formation
						- Calcification following blood vessel
						- ECM → Trabeculae → Spongy bone
						- Free Osteoblasts → Periosteum
					- Compact bone development
						- Osteoblast forms compact bone under periosteum
				- Endochondral Ossification
					- 6-8 weeks after conception - Adolescence @ Skull base, Long bone
					- Replacing and breakdown of Hyaline cartilage
					- Initial: Fetal hyaline cartilage w/ perichondrium
					- Perichondrium → Periosteum
					- Blood vessel grows in periosteum
						- No blood in cartilage → Dead Chondrocyte
						- Calcium transported to periosteum → Forming Periosteal bone collar (Compact bone)
					- Dead Chondrocyte → Degenerating Hypertrophic cartilage → Developing Blood vessel & spongy bone in Diaphysis
						- Primary ossification center @ Diaphysis
						- Compact bone formation → medullary cavity w/ capillary
					- Epiphyseal capillaries → Secondary ossification center @ Epiphyses
						- Capillaries throughout → Spongy bone
					- Remaining cartilage: Metaphysis, Epiphyseal plate
						- No blood (calcium) → bone can elongate and slowly replacing metaphysis
						- Epiphyseal line (between Ossification centers) left, cannot elongate further
			- Blood, Nerve, Lymph
				- Arteries & Vein
					- Nutrient foramen (hole for artery), foramina (hole for vein) @ Diaphysis (Primary Ossification Center)
					- Epiphyseal, Metaphyseal artery & vein (smaller)
				- Nerve → Pain sensation (most) & Regulate blood supply
		- Cartilages
			- Classification
				- Hyaline cartilage (most cartilage)
					- w/ Perichondrium
				- Fibrocartilage (pubic symphysis, intervertebral disc)
					- Elastic, Withstand force, Less motion
					- \w/ Collagen Fibers
				- Elastic cartilage (External ear, Epiglottis)
					- Elastic structures
					- w/ Perichondrium & Elastic Fibers
			- Structure
				- Extracellular matrix
				- Lacuna w/ chondrocyte
					- Release Hyaluronic acid in Hyaline Cartilage
					- Synthesize Collagen Fiber in Fibrocartilage
					- Synthesize Elastic Fiber in Elastic Cartilage
			- Cells: Chondroblast → Chondrocyte (differentiate & trapped in lacuna)
		- Joints
			- Structural Classification
				- Fibrous Joint: Fibrous tissue at junction
					- Usually Synarthrosis
				- Cartilagenous Joint: Cartilage at junction
					- Usually Amphiarthrosis
				- Synovial Joint: Joint cavity w/ synovial fluid
					- Usually Diarthrosis
			- Functional Classification
				- Synarthrosis (Immobile Joint)
				- Amphiarthrosis (Slightly Movable Joint)
				- Diarthrosis (Freely Movable Joint)
			- Classification of Synovial Joint by shape of articulating surface
				- Pivot: Uniaxial
					- Horizontal rotation
				- Hinge: Uniaxial
					- Sagittal flex/extend
				- Saddle: Biaxial
					- Sagittal flex/extend
					- Coronal abduct/adduct
				- Condyloid: Biaxial
					- Sagittal flex/extend
					- Coronal abduct/adduct
				- Plane: Multiaxial
					- Sagittal flex/extend
					- Coronal abduct/adduct
					- Horizontal rotation
				- Ball-and-Socket: Multiaxial
					- Sagittal flex/extend
					- Coronal abduct/adduct
					- Horizontal rotation
	- Muscular System
		- Skeletal muscles: Muscle & Tendon
