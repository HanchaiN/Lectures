# How does the Body Move

- Musculoskeletal System → Skeletal System + Muscular System
- Skeletal System
	- Bones (206 in adults) & Cartilages & Ligaments
		- Joints
	- Bones
		- Functions
			- Support the body, Protect internal organs
			- Facilitate movement
			- Produce blood cell (Hematopoiesis; @Red bone marrow)
			- Store & release minerals (e.g. Calcium) & fat (Yellow bone marrow)
			- Endocrine System
				- PTH → Activate Osteoclast; Release Calcium
			- Fracture callus; Require Calcium to heal
				- PTH → More Calcium in blood
				- GI Tract synthesize Vitamin D → More Ca absorption
		- Classification by Shapes
			- Long bone: Leverage
			- Short bone: Stability, Support w/ motion
			- Flat bone: Muscle attachment, Protection
			- Irregular bone: Protection
			- Sesamoid bone: Protect tendons from compressive force (usually embed in tendon)
		- Structure (Long bone)
			- Diaphysis: Center, Tubular shaft, compact bone w/ cavity
				- Medullary Cavity w/ Yellow bone marrow (Adipose tissue)
			- Metaphysis: In between
				- Epiphyseal plate (growth plate): Hyaline cartilage
					- Calcified to Epiphyseal line: no longer grow
			- Proximal / Distal Epiphysis: Wider part at each end

					- ECM → Trabeculae → Spongy bone
					- Free Osteoblasts → Periosteum

			- Endochondral Ossification
				- 6-8 weeks after conception - Adolescence @ Skull base, Long bone
				- Replacing and breakdown of Hyaline cartilage
				- Initial: Fetal hyaline cartilage w/ perichondrium
				- Perichondrium → Periosteum
				- Blood vessel grows in periosteum
					- No blood in cartilage → Dead Chondrocyte
					- Calcium transported to periosteum → Forming Periosteal bone collar (Compact bone)
				- Dead Chondrocyte → Degenerating Hypertrophic cartilage → Developing Blood vessel & spongy bone in Diaphysis
					- Primary ossification center @ Diaphysis
					- Compact bone formation → medullary cavity w/ capillary
				- Epiphyseal capillaries → Secondary ossification center @ Epiphyses
					- Capillaries throughout → Spongy bone
				- Remaining cartilage: Metaphysis, Epiphyseal plate
					- No blood (calcium) → bone can elongate and slowly replacing metaphysis
					- Epiphyseal line (between Ossification centers) left, cannot elongate further
		- Blood, Nerve, Lymph
			- Arteries & Vein
				- Nutrient foramen (hole for artery), foramina (hole for vein) @ Diaphysis (Primary Ossification Center)
				- Epiphyseal, Metaphyseal artery & vein (smaller)
