# Internal Regulation of Human Body

## Hormonal Action

- Cellular Signaling
    - Autocrine: Self-signaling
    - Contact-dependent: Connected cells via gap junction
    - Paracrine: Nearby cells
    - Endocrine: Distant cell trough bloodstream
- Pathways of Hormonal Action
	- Lipid-soluble hormones
		- Through Plasma membrane, Receptor-Hormone Complex @ Cytoplasm
	- Water-soluble hormones
		- Cell membrane receptor → Secondary messenger
		- Secondary messenger + Cytoplasmic receptor
- Factor affecting Cell Response
	- Upregulation / Down regulation of receptor
	- Interaction of hormones
		- Permissive: One strengthen the other
			- e.g. TH increases Epinephrine receptor
		- Synergistic: Acting together for greater effect
			- e.g. FSH & Estrogen
		- Antagonistic: Opposite Effect
			- e.g. Insulin & Glucagon
