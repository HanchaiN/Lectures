# How the Human Body Develop

## Human Reproductive Cycle

- Female Reproductive Cycle: Menstrual cycle
	- Every ~28 days
		- Day 1: Menstruation begins
			- Uterine cycle phase: Menstrual flow
		- Day 5: Menstruation ended (usually)
			- Uterine cycle phase: Proliferative phase: Endometrium formation
		- Day 14: Oocyte matured, Follicle released, Ovulation
			- Follicular phase (pre-ovulation): Follicle → Estrogen
			- Luteal phase (post-ovulation): Corpus luteum → Progesterone & Estrogen (Low)
				- w/o Fertilization → Begins Uterine secretory phase
		- Day 26: w/o Estrogen/Progesterone → Endometrium breads down
		- Day 28: ~Day 1
	- After puberty; Until menopause: age 45-55
	- Release 1 oocyte (produced before birth) per cycle
	- Endocrine: Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal axis
- Male Reproductive Cycle
	- Sperm production begins at puberty
		- Continuous life-long production
	- Release millions of sperm; require activation, capacitation
	- Endocrine: Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal axis
	- Given health, there's sex urge & ability to father children

## Gametogenesis & Fertilization

- Gametogenesis: Diploid Primordium Germ Cell → Haploid Gamete Cell
- Oogenesis
	- Oogonium (Mitosis) → Primary Oocyte
		- During Prenatal phase
	- Primary Oocyte (Meiosis I) → Secondary oocyte + Polar body
		- Paused in Prophase I; continue on Menstrual cycle
	- Secondary oocyte (Meiosis II) → Ovum + Second polar body
		- Pause in metaphase II, continue on Fertilization
- Spermatogenesis (Continuous after puberty)
	- Spermatogonium (Mitosis) → Primary Spermatocyte
	- Primary Spermatocyte (Meiosis) → Secondary Spermatocyte → Spermatid
	- Spermatid (Differentiation) → Spermatozoa
- Fertilization: (2) Haploid Gametes → Diploid Zygote
	- Oocyte + Sperm @Ampulla of Uterine tube (aka Fallopian tube, oviduct)
	- Sperm undergoes capacitation, binds, and fuses w/ oocyte

## Human development timeline

- Pregnancy: 9 months / 38 weeks
	- Trimester (First / Second / Third)
	- Embryonic (8 weeks ~ First Trimester) / Fetal period
		- Embryonic Period → Embryo w/ almost all organs
