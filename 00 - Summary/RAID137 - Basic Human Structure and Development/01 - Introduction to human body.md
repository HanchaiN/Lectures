# Introduction to Human Body

- Anatomy: Study of body's structure
	- Macroanatomy (Gross anatomy): Larger structure w/ naked eye
	- Microanatomy (Histology): Smaller structure under microscope
		- Histology: Tissue Level
		- Cytology: Cellular Level
	- Embryology: Human development
	- Regional Anatomy: By body region; Relative size & location
	- Systemic Anatomy: By functionality
- Physiology: Study of chemistry & physics of the body (functionality)
- Structural Organization of Human Body
	- Chemical
	- Cellular: Independently functioning unit
	- Tissue: Specific function w/ similar cells
	- Organ: Anatomically distinct w/ 2 or more tissue
	- Organ System: Major function
		- Note: Most organs contribute to multiple organ systems
	- Organism: Independently perform all necessary function
- Functions of Human life
	- Metabolism: Chemical processes → Regulation, Energy
		- Anabolism (Small + Energy → Large + Heat)
		- Catabolism (Large → Small + More Heat + Energy)
	- Responsiveness: Adjust to changes
	- Movement: Cellular level, Tissue level, Organ level, Body level
	- Development
		- Differentiation: Specialization for specific task
		- Growth: Increase in size, number, extracellular materials
		- Renewal: Growth, Repair, Replacement
	- Reproduction: New organism from parent organism
- Requirements for human life
	- Oxygen: for Energy (ATP)
		- Brain damage likely within 5 minutes
		- Death likely within 10 minutes
	- Nutrients
		- Water
		- Energy-yielding: Carbohydrates & Lipids
		- Micronutrients: Vitamin & Minerals
	- Narrow range of Temperature ($\approx \pu{37 \degree C}$) ← Hot-blooded animal
		- Heat Response: Vasodilation, Sweat
		- Cold Response: Vasoconstriction, Shivering
	- Narrow range of atmospheric pressure → Ability to breath
		- Altitude sickness, Decompression sickness
- Homeostasis: Maintain internal conditions in normal range
	- Normal range: Optimally healthful & Stable
	- Set point: center of normal range
	- Negative Feedback: Reverse a deviation
	- Positive feedback: Exaggerate a deviation
- Tissues
	- Epithelial Tissue (Epithelium)
		- Epithelial cells on Basement membrane
		- Classified by
			- Number of layers: Simple / Stratified / Pseudostratified
				- Pseudostratified Columnar
			- Free surface: Ciliated / Keratinized type / Non-Keratinized type (optional)
			- Morphology: Squamous / Cuboidal / Columnar
		- Functions
			- Protection
			- Transcellular transport, Secretion, Absorption
			- Control of movement of ions and molecules
			- Detection of sensation
	- Connective Tissue (CNT)
		- Cells in extracellular matrix between tissues
		- Connective tissue proper: Loose / Dense
		- Specialized connective tissue: Reticular, Blood, Bone, Cartilage, Adipose
	- Muscle Tissue
		- Skeletal (Generally voluntary except diaphragm)
		- Smooth
		- Cardiac
	- Nervous Tissue → CNS, PNS
		- Neurons
		- Glial cells (Neuroglia)
