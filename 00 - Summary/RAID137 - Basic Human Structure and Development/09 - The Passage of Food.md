# The Passage of Food

- Digestive System
	- Gastrointestinal Tract (Alimentary Canal)
		- Mouth: Ingestion, Mechanical & Chemical Digestion
		- Pharynx: Move food from oral cavity to esophagus
		- Esophagus: Move food from pharynx to stomach
		- Stomach: Mechanical & Chemical (Gastric Enzyme)
		- Small Intestines: Digestion & Absorption
		- Large Intestines
		- Anus: Defecation
	- Accessory Digestive Organs
		- Salivary Glands: Digestive Enzymes, Moises & Mixing
		- Liver: Bile production
		- Gallbladder: Bile Storage
		- Pancreas: Digestive Enzymes, Hormones
- Tissue Layers of GI Tract
	- Mucosa: Direct contact w/ Food
		- Epithelium
		- Lamina Propria
	- Submucosa: Blood & Lymph vessels, Submucosal Glands, Nerves
		- Submucosal plexus: Nerve
	- Muscularis: Muscular, Mechanical Digestion, Food Motion
		- Myenteric plexus: Nerve (between muscle fibers)
	- Serosa, Adventitia: Connective tissue w/, w/o Visceral peritoneum resp.
- Digestive Processes
	- Fundamental Activities
		- Ingestion
		- Propulsion (Deglutiton, Peristalsis)
		- Chemical Digestion
		- Mechanical Digestion (Chewing, Churning, Segmentation)
		- Absorption
		- Defecation
	- Voluntary / Involuntary
	- Hormonal / Neural Regulation
	- Many activities per organs and vice versa
- Deglutition (Swallowing)
	- Voluntary Phase: Oral / Buccal
		- Tongue moves upward & backward
		- Bolus pushed into Oropharynx
	- Pharyngeal Phase
		- Uvula & Soft palate moves upward & close nasopharynx
			- Prevent aspiration & choking
		- Laryngeal muscles contraction
		- Pharyngeal constrictor muscles contraction
		- Upper esophageal sphincter relaxation
	- Esophageal phase
		- Initiation of Peristalsis
		- Bolus moves toward stomach
		- Lower esophageal sphincter relaxation
