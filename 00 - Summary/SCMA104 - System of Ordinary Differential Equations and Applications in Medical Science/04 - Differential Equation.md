# Ordinary Differential Equation

- Differential Equation: Functional Equation with differential
	- Ordinary Differential Equation: Single independent variable: $F(t,y,y^\prime,\dots,y^{(n)})=0$ (with $u^\prime=\frac{d}{d t}u$)
		- Linear Differential Equation: $L[y]=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_{n}(t)y^{(i)}(t)=g(t)$  
		  ($L$ is an $n$-th order linear differential operator)
			- Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation: $L[y]=g(t)=0$
	- Partial Differential Equation: Multiple independent variables (with $u_x=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u$, assume that other independent variables are independent/constants relative to $x$)
- Autonomous Differential Equation: No explicit dependent of independent variable: $F(y,y^\prime,\dots,y^{(n)})=0$ (For ODE, may include $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}} y$ for PDE)
- Homogenous Differential Equation: Homogenous function of derivatives and independent variables
	- $\exists k_{i},l\;\forall\lambda$ If $(x_{i}, y)$ is a solution, $(\lambda^{k_{i}} x_{i}, \lambda^{l} y)$ is also a solution.
		- Since $\bar{y}=\lambda^{l} y(\lambda^{-k}t)$, then $\bar{y}^{(n)}=\lambda^{l-nk} y^{(n)}$.
	- $k=0$ and (WLOG) $l=1$: Homogeneity by function  
	  (as in Homogenous LDE/LPDE, provably equivalent to $L[y]=0$)
	- $k=l$ and (WLOG) $l=1$: Uniformly homogenous  
	  (as in Homogenous First-order ODE: $M(x,y)dx=N(x,y)dy$)
		- $\overset{\lambda=\frac{1}{x},y=ux}{\implies} u^{\prime}x+u=y^{\prime}=\frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}=\frac{\lambda^{\alpha}M(\lambda x,\lambda y)}{\lambda^{\alpha}N(\lambda x,\lambda y)}=\frac{M(1,u)}{N(1,u)}=f(u)$
- Order: highest order of differentiation in canonical forms (no integral terms, use FTC-I)
- Degree: the maximum degree (sum of exponents) of the highest order term
- Solution
	- Define on some open interval.
	- Differentiable up to the equation's order.
	- Satisfy the DE ($F(t,y,y^{\prime},\dots,y^{(n)})=0$ for ODE).
	- Initial value problem: DE w/ initial conditions: exact value of $y(t_{0}),y^{\prime}(t_{0}),\dots,y^{(n)}(t_{0})$
		- General solution will have arbitrary constants (related to constant of integration)
		- Exact solution (w/ initial value): solved for the constants using initial conditions
	- Explicit solution: have the forms of $y(t)$
	- Superposition principle
		- (Linear superposition) If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions of the Homogeneous LDE, their linear combination (i.e. $c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}$) are also solutions of the same DE.
- Wronskian ($W(f,g)=f\cdot g^{\prime}-g\cdot f^{\prime}$)
	- Generally, $W(f_{1},\dots,f_{n})=\det\begin{bsmallmatrix}f_{1}&f_{2}&\dots&f_{n}\\ f_{1}^{\prime}&f_{2}^{\prime}&\dots&f_{n}^{\prime}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots \\ f_{1}^{(n-1)}&f_{2}^{(n-1)}&\dots&f_{n}^{(n-1)}\end{bsmallmatrix}$
	- If the Wronskian is non-zero, the functions $f_{i}$ are linearly-independent.  
	  (If the Wronskian is zero, it is inconclusive.)
		- For $n$-th order homogenous LDE, the $n$ independent solutions are the bases that span through all general solutions.
		- The last solution can be find by solving for the Wronskian first.
- Abel's identity
	- For Second-order homogeneous LDE ($y^{\prime\prime}+p y^{\prime}+q y = 0$), the Wronskian $W=c\cdot e^{-\int p(t)dt}$ (on an interval where $p$ and $q$ is continuous.
- Solving Techniques
	- Separation of Variable
		- (First-order ODE): $P(y)dy=Q(t)dt$ â†’ $\int P(y)dy = \int Q(t)dt$
			- Note: $P$ and/or $Q$ may be constants, multiplicative inverse, or quotients
	- Integrating Factor
		- Multiply both side by some factor to make it easier to integrate
		- $y^{\prime}+p(t)y=g(t)$ (First-order LDE): $\mu(t)=e^{\int p(t) dt}$  
		  $(y\cdot\mu)^{\prime}=y^{\prime}\cdot\mu+y\cdot\mu^{\prime}=y^{\prime}\cdot\mu+y\cdot\mu\cdot p=(y^{\prime}+p\cdot y)\cdot \mu=(g\cdot\mu)$
	- Homogenous First-order ODE ($M(x,y)dx=N(x,y)dy$ where $M$ and $N$ are homogenous function with equal degree $\alpha$)
		- $\overset{\lambda=\frac{1}{x},y=ux}{\implies} u^{\prime}x+u=y^{\prime}=\frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}=\frac{\lambda^{\alpha}M(\lambda x,\lambda y)}{\lambda^{\alpha}N(\lambda x,\lambda y)}=\frac{M(1,u)}{N(1,u)}=f(u)$
	- Second-order homogeneous LDE w/ (real) const. coefficient ($a y^{\prime\prime}+b y^{\prime}+c y = 0$)
		- Solve characteristic equation: $ar^{2}+br+c=0$
		- If $r_{1}\ne r_{2}$, $y=c_{1}e^{r_{1}t}+c_{2}e^{r_{2}t}$
			- If $r_{1}\ne r_{2}=\lambda\pm\mu i\in\mathbb{C}$, $y=e^{\lambda t}\left(A\sin(\mu t + \phi)\right)$
		- If $r_1=r_2$, $y=c_{1}e^{rt}+c_{2}te^{rt}$
	- $n$th-order homogeneous LDE w/ const. coefficient ($\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} a_{i}y^{(i)} = 0$)
		- Solve characteristic equation: $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} a_{i}r^{i} = 0$  
		  (Assume that the solution is in the forms of $e^{rt}$ so that it can cancel its derivatives out.)
		- For each simple root $r$, the associated bases solution is $e^{rt}$.
		- For each multiple root $r$ (with multiplicity $k$), the associated bases solution are $t^{i}e^{rt}$ for $i=0,\dots,k-1$. (Reduction of Order)
		- The general solution are the linear combinations of the bases.
	- Non-homogeneous LDE w/ const. coefficient ($\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} a_{i}y^{(i)} = g(t)$)
		- The general solution is $y_c+y_p$ where
			- Complementary function ($y_c$) is the solution of the homogeneous DE ($\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} a_{i}y^{(i)} = 0$).
			- Particular integral ($y_p$) differs for each LDE.
