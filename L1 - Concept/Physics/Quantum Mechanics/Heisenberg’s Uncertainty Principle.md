# Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle

- $\Delta x \Delta p_x \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}​$  
  One cannot precisely observe the position and the momentum of the particle at the same time; This is not due to the issue of the observation but rather that the information does not exist in the first place.
- $\sigma_x \cdot \sigma_{p} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$  
  Since wavefunction is a continuous function, there’s no definite bound. It’s only meaningful to discuss the standard deviation of the measured value according to the probability distribution
