# De Broglie Wavelength

- $\lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}$  
  From Planck relation: $E=h\nu=h\frac{c}{\lambda}$  
  From mass-energy equivalence: $E=mc^2=pc$  
  $\therefore \lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}$
- Since normal objects donâ€™t move at the speed of light, we can use $v$ instead of $c$.  
  Note: de Broglie uses a different equation for mass-energy equivalence and does not abuse the notations.
